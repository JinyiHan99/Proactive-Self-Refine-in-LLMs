{"id": 29870980, "question": "I called it a circus act, a freak show. I said it had all the weird fascination of one of those Victorian Odditoriums with Wang the Human Unicorn and Ella the infamous Camel Girl. The appeal of an Old Firm derby is not so much the football but the grisliness surrounding the football.\nThat's the marketability of this game - the rot. It's not known as one of the most storied derbies in world football because of the quality of the action on the field. Maybe it was back in the day - undoubtedly it was - but that hasn't been the case for a long time now.\nThose who get drawn to it do so because of its essential madness, its toxicity, its poison. That's an uncomfortable admission given the nature of some of the things that go on around this match - the bigotry, the violence, the viciousness and hysteria on social media. But it's the truth.\nAt its craziest, it's football's equivalent of the Jim Rose Circus. And, love it or loathe it, for the next three months, there will be little escape from it.\nIt's back - or soon will be. It was inevitable. Plenty have missed it. Plenty of others have not.  It is possible to celebrate its return while also having an acute dread. That might seem like a contradiction, but in the strange world of the Old Firm, it makes some kind of sense.\nBy the time it comes around, it will have been almost three years since the previous meeting of these two clubs. Expect that to be reflected in the acreage of newsprint and radio hours that will be expended on this Scottish League Cup semi-final.\nBefore a previous meeting, I spent the week counting the number of newspaper pages given over to the fixture, from the Monday before to the Monday after. I gave up halfway through when the count had soared to over 100. One title had 27 pages dedicated to the game on one day alone. After a gap of three years, the mind boggles as to what lays ahead in terms of countdown.\nIf you stop your stopwatch at the point when it was obvious that they would be drawn together, it probably it took a fraction of a millisecond for the first tweets to land, like blows to the jaw of their rivals.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nSome among the Celtic support are steadfast in their belief that a unique occurrence is going to take place next year - the first meeting of the sides.\nSomething akin to virtual spontaneous combustion happened on social media. As commentators ran through the gamut of Things We Cannot Say (TWCS), there was a predictable and plentiful response.  \"Previous meetings\" - there's been none. \"Rivalry\" - doesn't exist. \"Rangers\" - no such club.\nThis coterie of Celtic fans say they see this League Cup semi-final as a match with no history. We must assume, by extension, that they believe the Celtic crowd at Hampden for the semi-final will be no more passionate and no more desperate for success than, say, a crowd at a Celtic v Dundee United semi; that victory, if it comes, will taste no sweeter than if it was Aberdeen they were playing.\nJust another semi-final? Really? Truly?\nListening to the reaction from Celtic Park would have done nothing for those who hang on to the belief that next year's meeting will be the first of its kind. Respectfully, the very people at the heart of their own club do not agree.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the draw, Ronny Deila, the Celtic manager, spoke about the renewal of the Old Firm derby. Stefan Johansen's comments were those of a man who believes that this is a continuation rather than a beginning.\nThey're not alone. From the boardroom to the dressing-room, Celtic people have spoken in the recent past (sometimes off the record for fear of incurring the anger of some of the support) about Rangers not as a new entity but as a club they were looking forward to playing against again  - if only for the financial benefits that will come with having their ground full and their media partners salivating anew at a minimum of four Celtic v Rangers matches every season.\nIn the real world, the Old Firm rivalry lives on and we'll see it in all its dubious glory on 31 January or 1 February. It will look the same, it will sound the same. Victory and defeat will engender the same response as it always has - joy and despair on an industrial scale.\nDeila said something else when he was asked for his reaction upon hearing the draw. He said that that the game was three months away and as a result \"it's a little bit early to be talking about it.\"\nGod bless him in his innocence. Rangers manager Ally McCoist knows only too well what's coming and it's a media whirlwind the like of which Deila has never seen before in his footballing life. If he thinks his time at Celtic has been intense then it's about to build to a dizzying high.\nDeila needs to strap himself in. There's turbulence ahead.", "answer": "A few years back, in the days before former owner Craig Whyte ever darkened Rangers' door and in a time when Charles Green was selling his bombast elsewhere, I wrote a column about the nature of the Old Firm derby as I saw it."}

{"id": 26277821, "question": "He brought a smouldering intensity to films such as Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago.\nA man of striking good looks he escorted some of the world's most beautiful women.\nBut he quit acting to become a ubiquitous presence at the world's most exclusive gaming tables.\nMichel Demitri Shalhoub was born in Alexandria on 10 April 1932 into a family of Lebanese ancestry.\nHis father was a wealthy timber merchant specialising in exotic woods.\nHis mother was a noted society hostess with King Farouk a regular visitor, before he was deposed in 1952.\nThe young Shalhoub studied at the British Victoria College in Alexandria where he showed himself to be academically gifted with a particular talent for languages.\nHe went on to graduate from the University of Cairo with a degree in mathematics and physics before joining the family business.\nBut he harboured ambitions to be an actor and, much to the disappointment of his father, went to London to study at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada).\nDuring the 1950s he appeared in a number of Egyptian films, rapidly becoming a star in his own country.\nHe also married the Egyptian actress Faten Hamama, converting from his Melkite Greek Catholicism to Islam so the union could take place.\nWhen David Lean was looking to cast a film about TE Lawrence, he picked out a photograph of Sharif and gave him a screen test.\nSharif's first on-screen appearance as Ali, riding across the sands out of a shimmering heat haze towards the camera, was one of cinema's most stunning debuts.\nLawrence of Arabia made him a truly international star. The film earned seven Oscars and nominations for both Sharif and his co-star, Peter O'Toole.\nHe followed this with another intense portrayal, that of the eponymous Doctor Zhivago, in Lean's 1965 Russian epic, based on the novel by Boris Pasternak.\nWith his black eyes and famous gap-toothed smile, Sharif was depicted as a type of Rudolf Valentino of the 1960s.\nHe later called this a triumph of hype over accuracy, but he certainly escorted some of the world's most glamorous women.\n\"I don't know what women are attracted to,\" he said, \"but certainly I have no notion about having any sex appeal.\"\nSharif admitted to falling madly for his co-stars, among them Ingrid Bergman, Catherine Deneuve and Ava Gardner.\nBut, disillusioned with the regime of Colonel Nasser in Egypt, he began spending more time away from his native country.\nThe Egyptian authorities were also angered by Sharif's role in Funny Girl, alongside co-star Barbra Streisand.\nThe actress was a vocal supporter of Israel and the Egyptians threatened to withdraw his citizenship when it emerged the pair were having a relationship.\nSharif's career failed to fulfil its early promise, and the actor was the first to admit he squandered his talent in pursuit of easy money.\nHe spent his time drinking away the days with O'Toole and other renowned hell-raisers. The evenings he spent gambling, a passion he inherited from his mother.\nTo fund his hedonistic lifestyle, not least his debts at the gaming tables, he appeared as the \"foreign gentleman\" in many mediocre films that exploited his looks and star quality.\nHe eventually turned his back on Hollywood in favour of the casino-rich capitals of Europe. He became particularly successful at bridge and was ranked among the world's best players.\nSharif's later life appeared like something out of one of the epic films of his youth, with elements of faded grandeur thrown in.\nThe money from his meteoric career mostly gambled or given away, Sharif based himself in a Paris hotel room, with sojourns to the local casino or the race track at Deauville.\nFellow gamblers continued to hang on the actor's every word, even though he famously gave up roulette after he lost ??750,000 in one night.\nHis behaviour became erratic. He was convicted of assaulting a policeman in Paris and, on another occasion, a Beverly Hills parking attendant.\nSharif later claimed his life might have been very different without the changes brought to bear by international stardom.\nBut he said he had no regrets. \"I don't know the meaning of the word. If I was back there again, I would do it the same way.\n\"Luckily, not everything I did was rubbish for money. I have had some great moments.\"", "answer": "Omar Sharif was the most famous Egyptian actor of his generation."}

{"id": 34591486, "question": "It was a commitment that in Mr Harper's nearly 10 years as prime minister had seen Canada, long viewed in the region as an honest, if minor, broker in the Arab-Israel conflict, shift emphatically and unequivocally to the Israeli side.\nWhile he will undoubtedly remain a friend of Israel, the incoming prime minister Justin Trudeau will also be aiming to repair relations with the Arab world in order to assert his firm belief that a two-state solution requires dialogue with both sides.\nBy contrast, Mr Harper managed to convey the impression that Muslims and Arabs were not to be trusted, most tellingly in his handling of the Syrian refugee crisis.\nHis government's response during the campaign to the drowning death of three-year-old Alan Kurdi, who was attempting with his sister and parents to join family in Canada, highlighted the hard fact that only a tiny number of refugees have been allowed into the country.\nEarly on in the campaign, Mr Trudeau committed Canada to taking 25,000 refugees immediately and he clearly caught the mood of the voters when he said:\n\"Canadians get it, that this is about doing the right thing, it is about living up to the values that we cherish in this country.\"\nAnd if there was a swing moment in this election, it was probably a debate in the province of Quebec, in French, about the niqab (a face veil).\nMr Harper had opposed the wishes of a new Canadian citizen to wear her niqab to the swearing in ceremony, even taking the case to the Supreme Court, where he lost. But he clung to his position that the niqab threatened the fabric of Canadian society.\n\"Most Canadians believe that it is offensive that someone would hide their identify at the very moment where they are committing to join the Canadian family,\" was how he put it.\nMr Trudeau on the other hand argued: \"It's obvious that he's playing very reckless and dangerous games, pitting Canadians against one another for a narrow political goal.\"\nMr Trudeau also took the view that Canada should withdraw its fighter jets from the bombing campaign against the so-called Islamic State.\nBut in a deft touch that showed he is no pacifist he promised to commit more troops to training up Iraqi and Kurdish ground forces to fight the jihadists while calling time on Canada's commitment to the aerial war.\nOn Iran, where the Harper government had cold-shouldered the nuclear deal and reaffirmed its support for Israel, Mr Trudeau again took a nuanced position, welcoming a \"significant agreement\" and affirming \"the importance of a diplomatic solution while ensuring Iran cannot build a nuclear weapon.\"\nOn every major Middle East issue Mr Trudeau offered a fresh take. Mr Harper with his unquestioning support for Netanyahu and his deep suspicion of Iran and much of the Arab world brought nothing new to the table. Having staked out his position, he proved incapable of moving from it, a fatal flaw with an electorate hungry for change.\nIndeed it is no small irony that while in the televised leaders' debates the Middle East received scant attention, on the campaign trail it may well have proven to be Stephen Harper's Achilles heel.\nNow, with the rout of the Conservatives still fresh, the most pressing issue and the one that Mr Trudeau can act quickly on is the refugee crisis.\nHow Canada's new prime minister responds will be a clear indication of just how significant a Middle East policy realignment his government is prepared to undertake.\nBill Law is a Middle East analyst and a specialist in Gulf affairs.

{"id": 40898319, "question": "Cameron Logan, 23, died in the blaze in Milngavie, East Dunbartonshire, and his girlfriend Rebecca Williams, 25, was seriously injured.\nLast month, Blair Logan, 27, admitted murdering his brother and attempting to murder Ms Williams at the family home.\nHe said he doused his sibling in petrol and set him alight but did not mean to kill him.\nAt the High Court in Edinburgh, he was given a life sentence with a minimum jail term of 20 years before he can be considered for parole.\nAn earlier hearing was told that the brothers had a \"hostile\" relationship and had not spoken to each other since 2013.\nIn a letter read to the court, his parents said they found it \"extremely difficult to reconcile the Blair that they know with the Blair that caused Cameron's death\".\nBoth parents were in the court room in Edinburgh, along with Ms Williams and her family, as the sentence was passed by Lady Scott.\nShe said Cameron was a \"happy and much loved young man\" who had died a \"horrible death\" and that Logan \"acted with wicked recklessness\".\nThe judge accepted court reports that he had \"abnormal personality traits\" and features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).\nBut she said there was no suggestion that Logan had a mental disorder and he was fully criminally responsible for his actions.\n\"Your motivation was malice,\" she said. \"You had planned this attack for a considerable time.\"\nLady Scott said Logan's actions had also dramatically affected the life of Ms Williams, who sustained \"truly terrible injuries\", and his parents.\n\"At the time Miss Williams was employed in her dream job in radio broadcasting - you have robbed her of her voice and her career, of her future with Cameron and of her confidence and sense of self-worth.

I cannot imagine the pain they will forever endure from what you did, losing in effect both their sons.\"\nIn a statement read by her father outside court, Ms Williams said Cameron Logan was a \"caring, respectful and loving man\" but their future together had been \"stolen\".\nShe added that no sentence would ever be enough for such a \"barbaric and ruthless\" murder.\n\"The horror of what happened in that room will haunt me forever,\" she said.\n\"Cameron died in the most cruel way, in front of my eyes. I can only imagine the pain and suffering he will have experienced in his final moments.\n\"I wish more than anything that I could have saved him.\"\nAn earlier hearing at the High Court in Glasgow heard that Blair Logan told police the brothers had not spoken since the death of their grandmother in 2013.\nThe attack was said to be in retaliation for a recent incident at the house when his brother had punched him.\nOn the night of the fire Cameron and Ms Williams slept on an inflatable mattress in the living room of the family home, after returning from a party at about 04:00.\nCatherine Logan, the brothers' mother, went downstairs at 07:15 and saw a dark figure in the living room.\nShe saw him throw something that was on fire and then run out of the house - but she did not know who he was.\nThe court was told that when she turned back to the living room, she saw \"orange and crackling\" and the room turning black.\nCameron and Ms Williams were screaming.\nMs Williams managed to crawl into the kitchen but was unable to open the back door.

{"id": 34292650, "question": "Activists are unlikely to be throwing themselves off the pier in despair. That's not really the Lib Dem way. The party has always thrived in adversity. The conference hashtag is #LibDemfightback.\nBut it will be a bittersweet experience for some party members.\n\"This is bound to be an emotional conference for us,\" writes Caron Lindsay, editor of LibDem Voice.\nThe party's \"brutal\" defeat in May is still raw, she adds. \"Being with our friends, mulling it all over with laughter, the odd tear and a whole load of gallows humour will undoubtedly help with that.\"\nHere is a full rundown of the main speeches and debates.\nThe party is talking up the fact that it has gained 20,000 members since May's general election - and about 2,500 of them are going to be in Bournemouth. This is a record, according to party sources, surpassing the number of party members at the 2010 post-election gathering.\n\"It's going to be a busy, buzzy conference,\" says Lib Dem activist Mark Pack.\nBut it will still be a very different kind of Lib Dem conference to those we saw during the coalition years.\nThere will be no government ministers speaking from the main stage for one thing.\nIt is likely to feel more sparsely populated too. The corporate lobbyists who flooded into Lib Dem conferences during the coalition years have all but deserted the party. This means the bars and restaurants will be quieter and there will be far fewer fringe meetings. Far fewer journalists too.\nThe party's new leader Tim Farron has long been a darling of grassroots Lib Dem activists but the general public have little idea who he is.\nHe will be under pressure to do something about that this week - and also to stake out exactly where the party stands in the rapidly changing landscape of British politics.\nHe has described the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader as a \"staggering\" opportunity for the Lib Dems to occupy the \"centre ground\" and attract back moderate Labour voters and members appalled by their new leader's hard left pedigree.\n\"There's no denying we're at one of the most challenging points in our party's history, but if anyone is going to lead us back, it's Tim,\" says a party aide.\n\"At conference you'll hear what motivates him, as he tackles the housing crisis, mental health, Europe, business and enterprise, the refugee crisis, and personal freedom.\"\nThe focus will be on next year's elections in Scotland, Wales and English local authorities - the first real chance to gauge if the party can revive itself.\nWhere exactly does Mr Farron, routinely described as a left-winger himself, and who defined himself as a break from the Tory-leaning coalition years, think the centre ground is? Aides say he is keen to dispel the idea, put about by some commentators, that he is \"Corbyn-lite\".\nParty members will be seeking answers at a Q&A session in the main hall on Monday. Mr Farron's keynote address will close the conference on Wednesday.\nTim Farron has mischievously let slip that he has been playing \"agony aunt\" to Labour MPs in despair at the election of Jeremy Corbyn.\nBut party sources are talking down the chances of defections any time soon. Certainly not during conference week.\nThe most senior Labour figure in Bournemouth will be former cabinet minister Peter Hain, now Lord Hain, who is down to speak at a fringe meeting.\nMr Farron and his team will be going all out to make their party look like an attractive option for disaffected Labour supporters.\n\"We once again see the prospect of a decade or more of Tory rule, and it fills us with dread,\" Mr Farron will tell activists at a rally on Saturday evening.\nTim Farron will not forget to shower some love on closet coalition fans who deserted the party for the Tories in May, his aides say.\n\"Britain is teeming with liberals, some of them are not yet in the Liberal Democrats. Some of them are in other parties. But we are their home,\" he will say on Saturday.\nMr Farron is setting himself up for a scrap with his party over Trident - carrying on in the grand tradition of Lib Dem leaders that have gone before him.\nConference will debate a motion on Monday backing unilateral nuclear disarmament - Mr Farron is planning to oppose it arguing that a cheaper option than a like-for-like replacement for Trident, such as ending round-the-clock submarine patrols, would be better.\nHe is also set for a rift with activists over airport expansion in south-east England. The membership voted for a blanket ban last year, but Mr Farron has told the Evening Standard that while he is against a third runway at Heathrow, he is \"open-minded\" about other options.\nFormer leader Nick Clegg is down to speak to conference on Monday, when he is expected to launch the party's campaign to remain in the EU in the forthcoming referendum.\n\"He will get a better reception than Tony Blair would at a Labour conference,\" suggests Mark Pack.", "answer": "The Liberal Democrats are gathering in Bournemouth for their annual conference - the first since the party lost all but eight of its MPs in May's general election rout."}

{"id": 31637090, "question": "He is Mohammed Emwazi, a Kuwaiti-born British man in his mid-20s from west London, who was previously known to British security services.\nBritish police declined to comment, citing ongoing investigations.\nEmwazi first appeared in a video last August, when he apparently killed the US journalist James Foley.\nHe was later thought to have been pictured in the videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines, British taxi driver Alan Henning, and American aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig, also known as Peter.\nIn each of the videos, the militant appeared dressed in a black robe with a black balaclava covering all but his eyes and top of his nose.\nSpeaking with a British accent, he taunted Western powers before holding his knife to the hostages' necks, appearing to start cutting before the film stopped. The victims' decapitated bodies were then shown.\nEarlier this month, the militant featured in a video in which the Japanese journalist Kenji Goto appeared to be beheaded. Hostages released by IS said he was one of three British jihadists guarding Westerners abducted by the group in Syria. They were known collectively as \"the Beatles\".\nMohammed Emwazi timeline:\nSource: Cage, London-based campaign group\n'Jihadi John' movement mapped\nEmwazi \"claimed harassment\"\nIn a news conference, Asim Qureshi, the research director of the London-based lobby group Cage, which had been in contact with Emwazi over a number of years, explained how he had been approached by the Washington Post for the story and detailed the difficulties Emwazi had had with security services in the UK and overseas.\nMr Qureshi said Emwazi, who is understood to be about 27, had been \"extremely kind, gentle and soft-spoken, the most humble young person I knew\".\nHe said he could \"not be 100% certain\" Jihadi John was Emwazi although there were \"striking similarities\".\nEmwazi's difficulties began when he travelled to Tanzania in May 2009 following his graduation in computer programming at the University of Westminster, Mr Qureshi added.\nHe and two friends had planned to go on a safari but once they landed in Dar es Salaam they were detained by police and held overnight.\nEmwazi then ended up flying to Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, where he claimed to be met by British intelligence agents from MI5 who accused him of trying to travel to Somalia, where the jihadist group al-Shabab operates. He denied the accusation and said the agents had tried to recruit him before allowing him to return to the UK.\nAnalysis: Frank Gardner, BBC News\nUS and British counter-terrorism officials discovered the identity of \"Jihadi John\" as far back as last September. The FBI, Britain's MI5 and other intelligence agencies used a combination of voice recognition software, interviews with former hostages and on-the-ground research in London to build up a profile of the man now revealed to be Mohammed Emwazi.\nThey have always declined to reveal the name for \"operational reasons\". Now that it's out in the public domain, it's emerged that Emwazi was well-known to MI5 and that it even tried to recruit him as an informer, years before he went off to Syria to eventually join Islamic State.\nThe practice by intelligence agencies of approaching jihadist sympathisers to work for them is likely to continue. It's believed both Britain and the US have informers inside the Islamic State \"capital\" of Raqqa. Yet this seems to have been little help in stopping the actions of Mohammed Emwazi, or bringing him to justice.\nProfile: Mohammed Emwazi\nJihadist's 'typical trajectory'\nEmwazi later moved to Kuwait, where he got a job at a computer company. But on a visit to London in 2010, he was detained by British counter-terrorism officials and prevented from flying back to Kuwait, his friends said.\n\"I had a job waiting for me and marriage to get started,\" Emwazi wrote in a June 2010 email to Cage.\n\"[But now] I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London,\" he added, \"a person imprisoned and controlled by security service men, stopping me from living my new life in my birthplace and country, Kuwait.\"\nMr Qureshi said Emwazi had made persistent efforts to try to change his situation: \"We had two-and-a-half years of communications talking about what he could do to alleviate his problems.\"\nHe said he did not know what had happened to Emwazi, adding: \"When we treat people as if they are outsiders they will inevitably feel like outsiders - our entire national security strategy for the last 13 years has only increased alienation. A narrative of injustice has taken root.\"\nEmwazi was believed to have travelled to Syria around 2013 and later joined IS, which has declared the creation of a \"caliphate\" in the large swathes of Syria and neighbouring Iraq it controls.\nA spokeswoman for Prime Minister David Cameron would not confirm or deny the latest reports, adding that the police and security services were working hard to find those responsible for the murder of the British hostages.\nThe University of Westminster confirmed Emwazi had left six years ago, adding: \"If these allegations are true, we are shocked and sickened.\"\nThe BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan in Washington says the FBI went on record last September to confirm it knew who Jihadi John was. However, US officials said this month they would not name him as they believed this would be the best strategy for finding him and bringing him to justice.\nA spokesman for the family of Steven Sotloff said: \"We want to sit in a courtroom, watch him sentenced and see him sent to a super-max prison.\"\nDavid Haines's sister, Bethany, welcomed the identification, but told ITV News: \"I think all the families will feel closure and relief once there's a bullet between his eyes.\"\nJihadi John sightings", "answer": "The masked Islamic State militant known as \"Jihadi John\", who has been pictured in the videos of the beheadings of Western hostages, has been named."}

{"id": 27110042, "question": "Her name features in everyday transactions in every town and city whenever a person goes to a cash dispenser, buys bread at a shop, pays a restaurant bill or a cab driver.\nBut only those who carefully study the banknotes will realise who Ms Gumataotao Rios is.\nThis Californian woman of Mexican descent has been treasurer of the United States since 2009.\nSince then, her signature has been printed on some 27 billion dollar notes.\n\"Currency and coins are the way we touch the American public every day,\" she tells BBC Mundo in her Washington DC office, just a few steps from the White House.\n\"We are part of history.\"\nWomen have left their mark on that history in a very special way, because they have held the position of US treasurer since 1949. Six of the past 10 treasurers have also been of Hispanic descent.\nMs Gumataotao Rios says that the first woman treasurer, Georgia Neese Clark, was appointed just after the Second World War, when women's participation in the workforce increased considerably.\n\"It was just very courageous and probably very symbolic for President Harry S Truman to make that appointment,\" she says.\nSince then, every US president has chosen a woman's signature to appear alongside that of the US secretary of treasury on one of the most popular currencies in the world.\nMs Gumataotao Rios explains that having women treasurers is not something that is institutionalised or has been done in order to fill a quota.\n\"They look at the individuals more than anything,\" she says. \"Clark, for instance, was a banker.\"\nShe also rejects the notion that her Hispanic heritage might influence her daily activities: \"Of course I am very proud to be Mexican-American, but in my role today I am an administration official.\"\nThe treasurer believes that her own previous experience in areas such as economic development, real estate and investments made her a good choice for the post at a time when the recent global financial crisis was at its height.\nShe also stresses that her work does not only consist of signing US banknotes, where her Mexican surname - Rios - appears next to her husband's Guamanian name, Gumataotao.\nAlthough Treasury Secretary Jack Lew makes the final financial decisions at the treasury department, Ms Gumataotao Rios supervises the nearly 4,000 employees who work at the US Mint and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.\nShe also oversees the gold reserves at Fort Knox.\nHer position has historic importance: it is the only office in the treasury department that is older than the department itself. Michael Hillegas, the first US treasurer, took up his post in 1775, even before the United States acquired its name a year later on 9 September.\nMs Gumataotao Rios is aware of that historic weight, but she also knows that her real link with most Americans is created through dollar banknotes.\n\"My signature is all over the world\", she says. \"It's a sense of professional pride and of personal pride for my family.\"\nThe first time she saw her name stamped on one of the green notes was the day after Thanksgiving in 2009.\nEarly in the morning, Ms Gumataotao Rios went to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Washington DC and was allowed to hold a freshly-printed sheet of uncut $20 notes. She was with her husband and two children, as well as the family of then-secretary Timothy Geithner, whose signature also featured.\n\"It was a very nice gift for my children, who were eight and 12 at the time. It's also their name on money,\" she adds.\nSince that day, the treasurer has kept copies of each denomination, including the recently printed new $100 note and the rare $2 bill.\n\"To have people know that a woman is representing our government is a very big milestone that has continued to this day,\" she stresses.\nShe is not the only woman to have a prominent role in the world of finance and politics, which has traditionally been male-dominated.\nFor instance, in February this year, Janet Yellen became the first female chair of the Federal Reserve, while Sylvia Mathews-Burwell, the White House budget director, has just been nominated as US health secretary by President Barack Obama.\n\"Women are playing a very significant role in economic dialogue, not just domestically but globally as well,\" says Ms Gumataotao Rios.\n\"The more we recognise that role women play, the more it will inspire future generations to also think about a career in finance and economics.\"", "answer": "Rosa Gumataotao Rios is one of the United States' most ubiquitous political figures, yet many people will probably have never heard of her."}

{"id": 34580067, "question": "Ahead of the vote, here are seven things you need to know about the West African country - once hailed as a model of stability.\nThe economy has boomed in recent years and Ivory Coast is the world's biggest exporter of cocoa, producing around 40% of the planet's beans used to manufacture chocolate. But this year, it also overtook India as the leading exporter of cashew nuts.\nCocoa transformed Ivory Coast into the \"Paris of Africa\" as it was called in the 1970s and 1980s, until a slump in cocoa prices dampened the \"Ivorian miracle\".\nPresident Alassane Ouattara, who took office in May 2011, wanted to diversify the economy. Agriculture is still the backbone, but it includes bananas, rubber and palm oil too.\nThe last elections in 2010 sparked five months of violence when former President Laurent Gbagbo refused to step down.\nMore than 3,000 people were killed in some of the most brutal violence the country has ever seen.\nPresident Ouattara has been accused of one-sided justice after hundreds of Mr Gbagbo's supporters were imprisoned but very few from his side were even arrested - despite the UN and international human rights organisations saying both sides committed atrocities.\nNo more \"nids de poules\" on the country's major roads. The French call potholes \"chicken nests\".\nThe government says it has built 1,000km (620 miles) of new roads since it has been in power and rehabilitated another 20,000km throughout Ivory Coast.\nIt is promising to build 1,200km more if re-elected.\nThere were 10, now there are seven.

Alpha Blondy, the country's undisputed king of reggae, began singing about war and fighting in the country as early as 1998.\nIn 2010, he openly backed former President Laurent Gbagbo, giving a free concert in Abidjan.\nHis main reggae rival, Tiken Jah Fakoly who sang anti-Gbagbo songs, had to go into exile and has decided to stay in Mali.\nAnd this election is no different when it comes to music and the main candidates have their songs.\nMr N'Guessan's talks about \"the fighters\" being \"tired\" and how they were all the \"victims of the political violence\" but Affi N'Guessan is their man.\nMr Ouattara's focuses instead on what the government has done for the economy, singing: \"With Ado, Ivory Coast wins.\"\nThe Elephants are the pride of Ivory Coast, and while football is a game and has nothing to do with politics, we all know that's not true.\nDidier Drogba has been attributed with single-handedly putting an end to violence that was raging in the country in 2005 when he fell to his knees on national television and asked fighters to lay down their arms.\nA week later they did.\nThis year Drogba, along with his former teammates and other international Ivorian sport stars, like sprinter Murielle Ahoure, have a new message for voters. \"Election c pas gnaga\".

{"id": 30737624, "question": "He worked under Billy Reid at Hamilton Academical, and advised Reid to move to Swansea City when the club wanted him to replace Paulo Sousa five years ago, but Reid chose to stay. He is now an assistant manager in Sweden's second tier.\nNeil is ambitious, and has always indicated a desire to test himself at the highest level. So he was always likely to accept the offer to succeed Neil Adams at Carrow Road. Reid was his friend, but also the man who shaped his career.\nNeil was a right-back when he pitched up at Hamilton from Mansfield Town in 2005; Reid restored him to a holding midfield role because of two significant qualities: his tenacity and his ability to read the game.\nThose traits have served Neil well. He only became Hamilton player-manager in April 2013, when Reid stepped down. Since then, he has guided the club to promotion - via the play-offs last summer - and to an eye-catching campaign in the Premiership, which has included topping the table in October.\nFor perspective, no side in the top division has a lower wage budget. Hamilton regularly field a team in which half of the players have come through the youth ranks, and he led the team to their first win at Celtic Park since 1938.\nFollowing that 1-0 win, Neil gathered all of the players and club officials in the dressing room and urged them to make the most of the moment, and to build on it. The display and result were typical of Neil - not least because he was booked in the second half, while still amongst the substitutes.\nHe has a steely edge, and can occasionally be overly aggressive. That tends to generally be controlled, though, and the spikiness will be required as he tries to impose his authority on the Norwich squad. Many of the players will be around the same age as Neil - who is 33 - and most will have played at a higher level and earned more money from their careers.\nIn a world where wealth and kudos are commodities, Neil must find a way to display leadership and motivation without compromising his principles.\n\"He's very calm and won't be fazed,\" said the former Rangers midfielder Derek Ferguson, who regularly reports on Hamilton games for BBC Scotland and whose youngest son is a youth player at New Douglas Park.\n\"I did my B coaching badge with him. He has an edge and that's really important.\"\nThe victory over Celtic was also typical of Neil because he was not prepared to limit his players or alter his tactical approach. Reid would often make Hamilton more defensive when they played bigger clubs, but Neil urges his players to have belief in their abilities and to trust in their game plan.\nThe approach has worked, which is why Neil became Norwich's choice to replace Adams. Reid believes that his protege will succeed, remarking on him being \"grounded\" and that there is \"no chance he will be overawed by the challenge down there\".\nReid has also spoken about his decisions being challenged by Neil in the dressing room, but with his captain asking questions \"in the right way\". Reid tasked him with personally overseeing the development of James McCarthy and James McArthur, who broke through at Hamilton as teenagers and now play for Everton and Crystal Palace respectively.\nNeil will become the second youngest manager in the Football League. Norwich even had to technically sign him as a player, since his registration needed to be transferred to the Football Association from its Scottish counterpart. As a manager, he is clear-sighted and principled.\nHis Hamilton side played passing football, initiating swift, incisive counter attacks that were built upon well-organised and strategically shrewd tactics. Always in a 4-1-4-1 formation, with forward-thinking players out wide.\nAccies' approach is so ordered and sound that individuals can fit seamlessly into different positions because they all know what is expected of them.\nNeil, like all of the new generation of managers, relies on comprehensive analysis of his own team's performance and those of opponents. The Norwich players will be used to that kind of approach, but Neil does face challenges.\nAt Hamilton, he had coached the younger age group teams before becoming manager, so had worked with many of the players already. They were also well-versed in the club's style, and most were young, so open to technical coaching and instruction. The players at Norwich will be more established in their ways. Even so, Neil is a strong character.\n\"I'm a very secure person,\" Neil has said. \"I have very few insecurities in terms of confidence, speaking to a group and putting my message across.\n\"I don't mind demanding the most out of them or booting someone up the backside if I feel they aren't pulling their weight. All these sides to the job don't really bother me. It's something that comes naturally.\"\nLike Reid, he is able to inspire players. Neil has spoken of his willingness to risk long-term injury to play for Reid, and the guilt he felt whenever he wasn't playing for the team, because he felt he was personally letting Reid down. After the news broke that Norwich and Hamilton had agreed compensation, many of the players leaving New Douglas Park looked visibly shaken and upset.\nIt is a small, close-knit club and Neil made sure to know the partners and families of his players. He will have to adapt to the size and demands of Norwich, but he is good at sizing up challenges.\nFollowing Reid might have daunted lesser characters, but instead of trying to copy his predecessor, Neil altered Hamilton's approach, so that the players were more focused on their own playing style, rather than countering the tactics of the opposition.\nNeil also capably handled the challenges of combining playing and management. He was often Hamilton's best player, and understood how to juggle the two roles. He once fined himself for indiscipline on the field, by taking 24 players out for a three-course lunch.\nNeil is a talented and capable manager. His inexperience will test the limits of his potential, and the job at Norwich is of a very different stature to Hamilton, but in his own mind he is ready.", "answer": "New Norwich City manager Alex Neil has learned from the successes and mistakes of his mentor."}

This proves they really can innovate,\" he says. \"No koala has ever walked under a road on a ledge ever before in its evolutionary history, and indeed they were doing it within a couple of months.\"\n\"They were able to learn new tricks far faster than anyone would have thought.\"\nThe study, published in the journal Wildlife Research, used multiple technologies to track individual koalas, including cameras, GPS collars and newly-developed wireless identification chips, which communicated with devices at the entrance and exit of each crossing.\n\"This is going to be very influential in terms of showing accurately and reliably that the animals do use these structures,\" Prof Jones says.\nCrossings and wildlife-proof fences were installed at hotspots where there had been continuous incidents of koalas being struck by vehicles.\nWhile roadways still pose a threat to koalas, Prof Jones says road deaths have \"almost vanished\" at sites where the crossings have been installed.\nKoalas are listed as vulnerable in Queensland, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, and are protected under national environment law.\nIn 2010, the Queensland government released a Koala Population Report, which showed there had been a 68% reduction in the local population of koalas near Brisbane over 10 years.\n\"This is a terrifying decline,\" Prof Jones says. \"It just can't go on, or else you really are looking at extinction down the track.\"\nDespite being tree-dwelling creatures, koalas are often moving along the ground in search of new trees, food sources, water and mates. A lot of this movement happens at night and roadways are considered one of the main threats to koalas.\nTo reduce the road toll, the state government began rolling out specialised wildlife fences. While these are effective at containing animals, Prof Jones says they are not a solution.\n\"It's really important that the animals are still able to move from one place to another,\" he says.\n\"If they get fenced off in two isolated patches their chances of survival are so much lower.\"\nProf Jones and his team were enlisted to help design a cost-effective solution. Rather than build new bridges, they decided to modify existing water culverts, or drainage tunnels, which pass underneath roadways. Elevated ledges were built to help keep the animals dry.\nTo test the effectiveness, the research team caught and tagged koalas on either side of the crossings, in a region stretching from Brisbane to the Gold Coast.\nOver the course of the 30-month study, the researchers verified 130 koala crossings, though only about 21% of the tagged koalas used the structures.\nThe team's cameras also caught a number of other animals using the wildlife crossings, including echidnas, goannas, possums and wallabies.\n\"They have used multiple techniques and shown that, yes, koalas will use these structures,\" says Associate Professor Mathew Crowther, a wildlife ecologist at the University of Sydney, who was not involved in the study.\nHe says the study is significant because it tests the effectiveness of the infrastructure.\n\"A lot of times, researchers just measure population drops on either side of the road,\" he says. \"Whereas here they are studying what the individual koalas are doing.\"\nProf Crowther says the biggest threat to koalas is habitat loss, and roadways are connected to that, forming \"killing fields\" between habitats.\nHe says wildlife crossings are a good option to help reduce road deaths of koalas and other animals, but they need to be monitored to ensure they are working.\nWhile Prof Crowther says it is interesting that some koalas have learned to use the structures to cross roads, he is not altogether surprised and says the animals' intelligence is often \"underestimated\".\nDespite poor vision, he says koalas have great hearing and sense of smell, and are constantly negotiating a very complex landscape.", "answer": "Koalas have quickly learned to use wildlife passageways to cross busy roads in Australia's Queensland state as they move between habitats, writes Myles Gough."}

{"id": 23419036, "question": "Scientists found that the long dry spell that year - the UK's most intense drought between 1914 and 2006 - killed off many drought-sensitive beech trees.\nGrowth of the trees is still restricted more than 30 years later, a study in the journal Functional Ecology said.\nThe more drought-tolerant Sessile Oak survived better and is now dominating the beech.\nThe scientific work was carried out at Lady Wood Park in the Wye Valley. This 45 hectare (111 acre) site is a national nature reserve and is attractive to researchers because it has been deliberately unmanaged since 1945.\nDetailed forest surveys have been carried out in the park over the past 70 years and the ecologists were able to use these along with tree ring data to discover how the different tree species fared over the period.\nBefore 1976, beech was the dominant species in this area. But that summer's drought has permanently changed the makeup of the forest.\nThat dry spell was the most exceptional drought in the years between 1914 and 2006 - it was 30% more intense than the next driest year, 1921.\nThe researchers found that in the period immediately after 1976, there was a significant growth in beech mortality. Between 1977 and 1992, 17% of these trees died, while there were no deaths among the oaks.\n\"The beech growth dropped very suddenly,\" said Prof Alistair Jump from the University of Stirling who carried out the work along with researchers from Joint Nature Conservation Committee.\n\"The Sessile Oak which is slightly less competitive but is more drought tolerant took advantage and grew much better - and beech has never fully recovered in the system.\"\nThe researchers say the oaks increased their growth rate by approximately 20% in the years immediately after 1976. The beech trees eventually stabilised their growth rate but only at around 75% of pre-drought levels.\nThe scientists say that beech trees can appear to tolerate drought without a long term impact until a threshold is reached.\n\"I think tipping point is a key idea, and that's something that we see very clearly in the work,\" said Prof Jump.\n\"They are resistant up to a point and then we hit a tipping point and the system shows very severe impacts.  The problem is we don't know where these tipping points are for other species.\"\nThe researchers say they expect the changes that they recorded at Lady Park Wood to have been replicated across the UK.\nThis perspective is echoed by Ray Townsend, arboretum manager at the Royal Botanic Gardens, at Kew.\nHe lived through the drought of 1976 and owns a home in the New Forest and he has been spending a good deal of time among the beech trees there in recent months.\n\"Quite clearly you can see that the beech aren't happy,\" he told BBC News.\n\"You can see evidence of the restriction of growth - I've seen that, the beech don't look as they should look - The oaks seem to be growing well, I'd never really thought about the reasons, but reading the research paper, it makes sense in a way.\"\nThe study's authors believe that extreme events such as the drought of 1976 are likely to increase in frequency in the future and there could be similar implications for other tree species.\nTo cope with these events, they say that forest managers need to manipulate the mix of species in their woods.\nBut despite the extreme heat of the last few weeks, the scientists say that 2013 will not have the same impact on trees as the dry days of '76.  That year was exceptional as it followed on from a rain-free 1975.\n\"This summer it won't happen,\" said Prof Jump.\n\"Last year we were at the point where we were forecast to exceed the 1976 drought and then we had this phenomenal amount of rain  - that replenished the water supplies and that means for this year it would be highly unlikely.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter.", "answer": "The sizzling summer of 1976 caused permanent changes to British forests, new research suggests."}

{"id": 39496149, "question": "It also demonstrates the growing calamity in the country where the conflict moves from phase to phase, but shows no sign of ending.\nPerhaps at the outset it should be established what we know. There seems no doubt that a chemical incident occurred, and there were Syrian government air attacks in the area. The opposition of course has no air force.\nThe West places the blame squarely on the Assad regime. Russia - one of President Assad's few allies - has a different story.\nIt says an air attack hit a weapons dump, thus releasing the chemical agent. All of the Western experts on chemical warfare contacted by the BBC have been highly sceptical about the Russian claim.\nAs yet there has been no clear analysis of samples from the location of the strike or from the victims. More information will undoubtedly become available.\nReports of the first significant use of chemical weapons - including Sarin nerve agent - by the Assad regime in 2013, prompted the international community's first purposeful diplomatic intervention in the Syrian War.\nThe Obama administration had marked down the use of chemical arms as \"a red line\", which, if crossed, would lead to serious consequences for the Assad regime.\nIn the event, President Obama decided to pull back and avoid military action. The US and Russia came together and brokered a deal under which the Assad regime would give up its chemical arsenal under international inspection.\nThe problem of chemical weapons in Syria appeared to have been resolved. But this was not so.\nSince then there have been sporadic reports of the further use of chemical weapons both by the Assad regime and so-called Islamic State. These have often involved the use of commercial chemicals like chlorine.\nBut this latest use of what looks to be a nerve agent like Sarin, and the frightful images of the attack, have underscored just how little progress has been made.\nBetween the Ghoutta attack in August 2013 to the incident in Idlib province this week, the situation on the ground in Syria has changed dramatically. Then the Assad regime seemed to have only a tenuous grip on power.\nThe policy of the West and its allies was to see Syria's leader - already branded by some as a war criminal - forced from office.\nThere was still a good deal of talk about a credible \"democratic\" opposition, which, if given sufficient means, could wrest control of much of the country from the Assad regime and IS alike.\nFast forward to today. Such hopes proved illusory.\nThe \"democratic\" opposition proved to have a very limited military capacity.\nMany of its most capable elements are closely linked to al-Qaeda: the next major problem that is likely to face the West some way down the line.\nThe Assad regime, bolstered by Iranian military assistance and Russian air power, has more than consolidated its position.\nAnd the most successful Western-backed elements of the opposition - the coalition of Kurdish and Arab fighters in northern Syria - may be advancing against IS, but its success brings a host of other problems, notably in relations with Turkey, whose troops and proxies already occupy a significant zone inside the country.\nThe saga of the West's response to the use of chemical weapons underscores the improvised and uncertain course of policy towards Syria almost from the outset.\nPresident Obama's declaration in 2012 that the use of chemical arms would cross \"a red line\" and change Washington's \"calculus\" seemed to go further than many of his advisers had expected.\nBut in the event - when push came to shove in 2013 - there were no punitive air strikes and the chemical disarmament deal seems now incomplete at best.\nNeither is US policy today any more coherent.\nThe Trump administration has roundly condemned the attacks, but President Trump himself has used the opportunity to condemn his predecessor for \"weakness and irresolution\" for not making good on his threats when the red line was crossed in 2013.\nHowever, back then, Mr Trump seemed to endorse the President's caution. He tweeted on 1 September 2013 that \"President Obama's weakness and indecision may have saved us from doing a horrible and very costly (in more ways than money) attack on Syria.\"\nToday, the international reaction in the wake of this latest episode is predictable and formulaic.\nWith Russia already providing an alibi for the Syrian regime, it is hard to see what can come out of the UN Security Council's meeting. It has been consistently and fatally divided on Syria since the outset of the crisis. But the chemical attack could still change \"the calculus\" around Syria to use President Obama's phrase.\nFor one thing, there will be a renewed debate about the whole question of \"safe areas\" and \"no-fly zones\" to provide protection to civilians, principally from regime air attack.\nIndeed the potential for such zones - especially in northern Syria close to the border with Turkey - has increased in the wake of the Turkish Army's entry on to Syrian soil.\nSuch zones though are a vexed question.\nAt some point - however defined or delineated - they require a willingness to take action against aircraft who strike inside them. Russia's air campaign complicates matters and so far has pretty well ruled out their establishment.\nThe chemical attack could change diplomatic calculations as well. The Trump administration's policy on Syria is still unformed.\nThe last major attack in 2013 brought Washington and Moscow together, albeit briefly. So far the Trump administration's much heralded reset with Moscow has proved elusive. Could this latest tragedy - whatever its cause - change that?\nThe Syrian crisis has decidedly entered a new phase - with new threats and new challenges emerging.\nPeace remains as elusive as ever.", "answer": "The response to this latest chemical \"attack\" in Syria will provide a measure of just how far the international community has come in struggling with the security crisis in Syria."}

{"id": 39657880, "question": "Earlier this week, the administration certified to Congress - as it must every 90 days - that Iran was abiding by the terms of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the formal name given to the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.\nBut the US Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, later underlined that his country's policy towards Iran was under full-scale review.\nAnd in a message that will be heard loud and clear in Tehran, he castigated Iran's \"alarming and ongoing provocations\" and described the country as \"the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism\".\nThere was a broader warning, too. \"An unchecked Iran,\" he said, \"has the potential to travel the same path as North Korea\".\nSo is the Trump administration behaving inconsistently? Well, probably not.\nCertifying that Iran is upholding its end of the bargain does not preclude a fundamental US policy review - one that would be normal for any incoming administration, and, given the personnel surrounding US President Donald Trump, is likely to be far from sympathetic to Tehran.\nThe Iran deal of course was famously characterised by then candidate Mr Trump as one of the worst deals ever negotiated. For now it is still there and for all we know it may have considerable life in it yet.\nThe problem for US policy is to grapple with three aspects of Iran and its behaviour.\nFirstly, there is the nuclear issue, and whatever the controversy surrounding the nuclear deal, it does impose constraints on Tehran's nuclear programme in return for tangible economic benefits. Iran at the moment is not \"unchecked\", to use the term mentioned by Mr Tillerson.\nMany western experts back the deal even if they have little enthusiasm for it. Even senior security figures in Israel - who opposed the Obama administration's negotiation of the agreement - have tacitly accepted that it does provide a framework to manage the problem.\nReports suggest that even the Saudis - also long-time opponents of the agreement - have counselled Mr Trump not to abandon it. Of course it will not last for ever. And one of the strongest arguments of the deal's critics has always been: What will happen 15 years after the implementation of the deal, when some of the key provisions restricting Iran's nuclear activities expire?\nOne hope was that it would provide a platform for improved relations between Washington and Tehran. Well that has not proved to be the case. Tensions are rising in the Gulf; the wider chaos in the region which finds Washington and Tehran almost always on different sides has seen to that.\nIndeed Mr Tillerson's tough rhetoric may inevitably influence the ongoing presidential election campaign in Iran - and not in a positive way, at least as far as western interests are concerned. The hope that by the end of the JCPOA's term, Washington will be dealing with a different Tehran, seems as fanciful as ever.\nBeyond the nuclear issue and bilateral relations there is the thorniest problem of all, Iran's regional role.\nIran is now a crucial player, from Syria to Lebanon; to Yemen and the wider Gulf. It is an active player in the wider struggle against Israel, and Mr Tillerson made a point of mentioning how Tehran was providing support to Hezbollah in Lebanon and to some Palestinian factions in the Gaza Strip.\nEven in Iraq, Tehran is a problem for Washington where both back the elected government, but where Tehran and its militias and advisers on the ground are seen as encouraging (or at the very least not discouraging) Shia sectarianism in Iraqi politics.\nThe supreme irony of course is that it was US actions - the removal of Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq - that helped propel Iran to this position of regional influence.\nGiven the concerns of Washington's Gulf allies there is a clear danger that Mr Trump's initial policy thoughts may be, for example, to step-up military support for the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen.\nNegotiating with Tehran seems to be as far away from the administration's thinking as talking to Pyongyang.\nThat is not to say that there is not plenty that Washington may legitimately oppose in Iran's actions. But Iran lives in the region. It has its own security concerns and issues. It has often felt marginalised and its views ignored.\nModerating Iranian behaviour is surely a reasonable goal for Mr Trump's policy review, as may be ensuring a measure of deterrence as well.\nBut it is hard to see how overturning the nuclear deal will improve matters in any way. This was not a bilateral agreement between the US and Iran but an international deal involving Russia and key EU countries.\nIndeed EU trade with Iran is growing significantly and the EU's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, recently underscored the EU's view that the deal is working.\nIf the US seeks to overturn it there could be serious strains in its relationship with some of its key allies. More significantly it would be very hard to restore the range and depth of sanctions that existed before - sanctions one might add that complicated Iran's life but did little to halt its nuclear programme.\nThe problem for Team Trump is to come up with a viable plan B; one that yields a comprehensive approach to the Iran problem in all its complexity.\nThe heady days of the US presidential campaign are over. Foreign policy is complicated - very complicated.  Interests, allies and principles have to be weighed and balanced against each other. The Trump policy review must contend with this reality.", "answer": "Once again rhetoric and reality in the Trump administration appear to be at odds with each other."}

As I wandered aimlessly, an assistant did offer to help me, so a big tick there.\nWhat would happen if I tried to buy something. New boxing gloves. Could I get an assistant to advise me?\nYes, as it turned out. A smiley young woman confidently explained the point of the different glove weights.\nOK, once I'd said I would buy them she tried to sell me a special offer on some \"workout make up\" but was quite happy when I said I'd think about it.\nSo how about trying to buy something for my sartorially conservative husband?

He came out with a football for his two-year old son.\nHe said he normally thought of the chain as a slightly downmarket depressing experience. \"so it definitely feels different\".\n\"Stuff is a lot better laid out, they've put a lot of thought into design and layout of everything,\" he added.\nAnother customer, Philip Yardy, described the design of the shops as \"open, appealing\" and encouraging people to walk through.\nBut Stuart Deveson wasn't quite so happy. He spent all of 10 seconds in there, he said. He agreed the entrance to the shop \"looks quite nice\", but said the reason he had walked out so quickly was because he'd gone in to buy shorts and couldn't find them.\n\"If they're not going to make it easy to find what I want, I'll go somewhere else,\" he said.\nSports Direct now has more than 25 new generation stores, of which 12 are \"flagship\" outlets.

Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said this had been a \"transformational\" year for Sports Direct.\nProgress was being made on the new premium stores, he said, and they were \"a lot more profitable than the existing Sports Direct stores\".\nInitial impressions from the shoppers I spoke to at least do seem positive.\nPerhaps the last word should go to customer Rory Bryant, who compared the Oxford Street flagship with another retail success story.\nHe said it was now \"more like Niketown up the road\", and perhaps that, as much as Selfridges, is the inspiration behind the chain's makeover.", "answer": "\"It's clear we have smashed the ball out of the park with our 'Selfridges' of sport concept,\" boasted Sports Direct chief executive Mike Ashley to financial analysts, following the release of the company's latest results."}

{"id": 34454264, "question": "It showed many people use computers instead of memorising information.\nMany adults who could still recall their phone numbers from childhood could not remember their current work number or numbers of family members.\nMaria Wimber from the University of Birmingham said the trend of looking up information \"prevents the build-up of long-term memories\".\nThe study, examining the memory habits of 6,000 adults in the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, found more than a third would turn first to computers to recall information.\nThe UK had the highest level, with more than half \"searching online for the answer first\".\nBut the survey suggests relying on a computer in this way has a long-term impact on the development of memories, because such push-button information can often be immediately forgotten.\n\"Our brain appears to strengthen a memory each time we recall it, and at the same time forget irrelevant memories that are distracting us,\" said Dr Wimber.\nShe says that the process of recalling information is a \"very efficient way to create a permanent memory\".\n\"In contrast, passively repeating information, such as repeatedly looking it up on the internet, does not create a solid, lasting memory trace in the same way.\"\nAmong adults surveyed in the UK, 45% could recall their home phone number from the age of 10, while 29% could remember their own children's phone numbers and 43% could remember their work number.\nThe ability to remember a partner's number was lower in the UK than anywhere else in the European survey. There were 51% in the UK who knew their partner's phone number, compared with almost 80% in Italy.\nThe study from Kaspersky Lab, a cybersecurity firm, says that people have become accustomed to using computer devices as an \"extension\" of their own brain.\nIt describes the rise of what it calls \"digital amnesia\", in which people are ready to forget important information in the belief that it can be immediately retrieved from a digital device.\nThe study highlights how, as well as storing factual information, there is a trend to keep personal memories in digital form. Photographs of important moments might only exist on a smartphone, with the risk of their loss if the device is lost or stolen.\n\"There also seems to be a risk that the constant recording of information on digital devices makes us less likely to commit this information to long-term memory, and might even distract us from properly encoding an event as it happens,\" said Dr Wimber.", "answer": "An over-reliance on using computers and search engines is weakening people's memories, according to a study."}
{"id": 34720751, "question": "The Labour leader said hospital waiting lists and financial deficits were rising and asked for a guarantee that the NHS, which he described as a \"jewel in the crown\", would be fully funded.\nThe PM said the NHS was treating more people and outcomes were improving.\nHe insisted that a strong economy was the backbone of a strong NHS.\nThe exchange comes amid a bitter row between health secretary Jeremy Hunt and junior doctors over proposed changes to their contracts.\nMr Corbyn said the prime minister was \"trying to dig himself out of a hole\" over the issue and Labour would be demanding more details of the government's latest pay offer.\nTurning to the wider situation in the NHS, the first time he has specifically raised the health service at PMQs since he became leader, Mr Corbyn quoted a senior figure from the Royal College of Emergency Medicine as saying \"this winter will be worse than last winter and the last winter was the worst we have ever had\".\nMr Corbyn said that, since 2010, waiting lists at English hospitals had gone up by a third, while 3.5 million people were now waiting to be treated. He went on to quote the King's Fund think tank which he said had warned of a \"rapid decline in patient care\" without extra funding.\n\"The NHS is in a problem, a problem of deficits in many hospitals, it's in a problem of waiting lists, it's in a problem of the financial crisis that has been faced with so many others.\n\"Can you address that issue and ensure everyone in this country can rely on the NHS which is surely the jewel in all of our crowns.\"\nMr Cameron said the Royal College of Emergency Medicine supported reforms to the NHS to create a truly seven-day-a week service and insisted that the government was committed to providing the billions in extra funding a year sought by senior NHS officials.\n\"I believe the NHS has the resources it needs and that is why we are seeing it treat more patients, more drugs being delivered, more tests being carried out. It is a much stronger NHS and the reason is simple. We have a much stronger economy.\"\nFor the fifth PMQs running, Mr Corbyn also raised the issue of tax credits, pressing the prime minister again for a guarantee that no-one would lose out from cuts to working tax credits from next April.\nHe cited the case of a serving soldier with children who he said would be Â£2,000 worse off.\nMr Cameron said the soldier in question would benefit from the increase in the personal tax allowance and an expansion in subsidised childcare but went on to defend the government's goal of a \"low welfare, low tax, high pay\" economy.\nHe told the Labour leader would have to wait three weeks until the Autumn Statement to learn the government's revised proposals following its recent defeat in the House of Commons, accusing him of opposing every single reform in the area and supporting unlimited benefits.\nMr Cameron tried to have some fun with some of Mr Corbyn's internal appointments, claiming that he had appointed a \"Stalinist, Trotskyite and Communist\" to his top team of advisers and he deserved \"full Marx\" for moving Labour to the left.\nThe Labour leader did not rise to the bait and stuck closely on policy issues rather than political banter.\nAmid barracking from the Tory benches, he paused his questions on several occasions, telling the chamber at one point that the weekly session was not \"about entertainment\" but getting answers to important questions from members of the public.\nThe SNP's John Nicolson asked Mr Cameron whether talks to \"imperil\" Channel 4 by privatising it had taken place. The PM replied that he was a \"huge fan\" of the channel, saying all options - including private investment - were being considered to safeguard its future. The SNP's Westminster leader Angus Robertson asked about the military covenant, which the government has enshrined in law, saying many service widows were being denied forces pensions because their personal circumstances had changed. Mr Cameron said people who had remarried were now able to get the full pension and that if further steps were needed these would be looked at.\nAfter the end of the session, which lasted nearly 40 minutes - almost 10 minutes longer than normal -  the prime minister was heard to say to the Speaker as he left the chamber that PMQs was getting \"longer and longer\".\nLast week's exchanges finished at 12:38.", "answer": "Jeremy Corbyn has warned of the risk of another \"winter crisis\" in the NHS as he and David Cameron clashed over health at Prime Minister's Questions."}

{"id": 35959949, "question": "Nigel Farage is wondering why, as Jonathan Portes has been pointing out, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures for migration to the UK from other EU countries is so much lower than the number of National Insurance numbers allocated to EU nationals.\nAccording to the most recent comparable statistics, migration to the UK from the rest of the EU was 257,000 in the year to September 2015, but during the same period, 655,000 EU nationals registered for National Insurance numbers (Ninos).\nMr Farage smells a rat: \"They are pulling the wool over our eyes. Ninos are a simple and clear reflection of the real numbers of people in this country, as without them you can neither legally work, nor claim benefits.\"\nNow the government has promised to tell us how many of the Ninos issued are still active - in other words, how many of the EU citizens who registered are currently paying UK tax or claiming benefits.\nBut are Ninos a good measure of immigration?\nThere is no question that the official immigration figures, based on a survey taken at ports and airports, are imprecise, with the ONS 95% confident that the immigration figure is within plus or minus 23,000 of the true figure.\nMore importantly, though, the ONS figures only aim to measure long-term migration. They use the UN's definition of a long-term migrant as someone who moves country for a year or more.\nWhen it comes to National Insurance numbers, on the other hand, there is no minimum stay in the UK. Everyone who wants to work in the UK must have a National Insurance number, even if they're only working in the country for a few weeks.\nWhat's more, Ninos are unique to an individual, so once you've received one, it's yours forever. This means that not all those who HMRC reveal to be \"active\" will necessarily belong to people who have been in the country continuously since their number was issued - they could have left and returned.\nThe ONS statistics also include people who are not planning to work or claim benefits, such as children or non-working partners. These people don't need a Nino when they arrive, but can apply for one in the future. This means someone registering for a Nino could have arrived at any time, not necessarily in the year or quarter in question.\nIt's not hard to see how the two sets of figures would be different. The question is, should they vary this much, or is there a problem with the way the ONS currently gathers its data? HMRC has said it will work with the ONS to help reconcile all available sources of statistics, including Ninos, to ensure the figures are as accurate as possible.\nWith this process rumbling on - and the latest immigration and Nino statistics due out on 26 May - this issue is sure to keep providing fuel for the EU debate, coming just a month before the referendum.\nReality Check verdict: There are good reasons why the two numbers would be different, but they are strikingly far apart, and next month's figures showing how many of the numbers are active should help reconcile the two.\nREAD MORE: The facts behind claims in the EU debate", "answer": "Campaigners to leave the European Union have been badgering the government about the reliability of the official immigration statistics."}

{"id": 39204953, "question": "The additional Barnett formula money will come from increased UK government spending on areas such as education.\nMr Hammond told the House of Commons that the additional funding demonstrated that \"we are stronger together in this great United Kingdom\".\nHe also confirmed additional help for the North Sea oil and gas industry.\nThe Treasury said the Scottish government would see its resource budget boosted by £260m over the next three years, and its capital budget by £90m over the period to 2021.\nIt said the money would be in addition to the £800m of additional Barnett funds announced by the chancellor in last year's Autumn Statement.\nThe Scottish government said the \"limited increases\" in Barnett consequentials meant the Scottish budget was still facing cuts of £2.9bn over the next decade.\nIts finance secretary, Derek Mackay, said: \"The real elephant in the room in this budget was Brexit. There was no mention of the UK government's plans to protect and grow the UK economy as the prime minister gets ready to trigger Article 50.\n\"This is simply not acceptable.

He announced that there would be £350m extra for the Scottish government to spend.\nThere then followed a showbiz moment: the Tories cheered and the chancellor grinned broadly while repeatedly gesturing towards the SNP benches, inviting them to join in the general hilarity.\nThe Nationalists, entirely understandably, declined to participate, sitting silent upon a peak in Darien or, rather, upon their benches in the Commons.\nBoth at Westminster and Holyrood, the SNP subsequently noted that the cash available, while welcome, was spread over three years and failed to compensate wholly for what they said were more substantial reductions over the past ten years.\nThere was precious little jollity, either, surrounding the issue of oil.

{"id": 36712152, "question": "Since 1943 Caversham Park has been the home of BBC Monitoring, whose offices still summarise news from 150 countries in 100 different languages for the BBC.\nBut after a Â£4m funding cut, the remaining journalists, academics and translators are to leave the country estate for new offices in London.\nAs the international newsgathering service enters a new chapter of its life, BBC News examines how Caversham Park shaped the news agenda in the mid-20th Century.\nThe monitoring service began at the outbreak of war with Germany in 1939, with its primary purpose to inform the War Office of propaganda by Nazi-controlled media outlets and the broadcasts of other Axis Powers.\nIt initially set up camp in shacks around Wood Norton, Worcestershire, but by 1943 the service had commandeered Caversham Park, which was at the time being used as a hospital.\nThe recorded history of the site goes back to the Domesday Book, when it was inhabited by relations of William the Conqueror, but by the 20th Century it was being used by the Catholic Oratorians as school. By 1941, the premises had been transferred to the BBC.\nMonitoring staff at Caversham would transcribe and summarise 240 broadcasts into an 80,000-word document called the Daily Digest. This was swiftly delivered to London by war despatch drivers.\nBBC Monitoring played a key role in tapping communications made by Hellschreiber (a kind of teleprinter) from Nazi Germany's propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels to newspaper and radio networks. A site outside London was chosen in part because it was less likely to suffer bomb damage.\nBy the end of the war 1,000 people worked at Caversham Park helping to provide the War Office and BBC journalists with up-to-date information from Axis Power news agencies.\nPeople of many nationalities worked at the monitoring station, including German-Jewish refugee Karl Lehmann, whose family fled Nazi rule.\nHe said: \"It was a very sociable place to work, in fact staff would often come in on their off days and eat in the canteen, which greatly eased the effects of rationing.\n\"There was a library in the building, and the park - so a pleasant place to spend a day off. In fact the building was almost like a club and the service was like one big family - even though there were nearly 1,000 of us here in total, from monitors to engineers and editors.\n\"We were all totally united in the one aim of winning the war.\"\nShortly after the end of Word War Two the service halved to about 500 members of staff, and attentions were turned to the burgeoning threat of the Soviet Union. The service covered the Soviets' invasion of Hungary in 1956 and the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961.\nIt played a key role in the Cold War, monitoring the events of the Cuban Missile Crisis as the USA and Soviet Union came close to nuclear conflict.\nIn 1962 President John F Kennedy told Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev to dismantle Russian missile sites in Cuba or \"face the consequences\".\nBBC Monitoring listened in to Khrushchev's response, which was broadcast on Moscow radio.\nHe said: \"The Soviet government has ordered the dismantling of the bases and the despatch of the equipment to the USSR. I appreciate your assurance that the United States will not invade Cuba.\"\nMonitoring contacted the White House through its US counterpart before Kennedy received Khrushchev's official response.\nAuthor and journalist Michael Smith worked at Caversham Park initially as an engineer, and then as a journalist in the 1980s until 1990. He said: \"I'm sure [BBC Monitoring] were part of it and important. At that stage their ability to know what was coming from Russia was tremendous.\"\nHe added: \"We were able to report on global news without being on the front line; it really crossed the divide between news and intelligence-gathering.\n\"I remember being the duty editor and news of the fatwa on Salman Rushdie came through from [Iranian] radio. At that time no-one in England knew what a fatwa was.\"\nBBC Monitoring still listens in on radio transmissions from around the world, as well as translating and analysing print journalism in 100 different languages, but the journalists and academics now have the added task of scouring the internet for news.\nIn 1991 the Berkshire-based listening post heard a live broadcast of Somali rebels taking over a government-run radio station in Mogadishu at the outbreak of the country's civil war.\nMonitoring also analysed the fall of Gaddafi during the Libyan Civil War by listening to medium-wave radio signals and using satellites to watch TV broadcasters in the country.\nThroughout World War Two and the Cold War, little was known of BBC Monitoring and it was heavily financed by the Ministry of Defence and Foreign Office, as well as the World Service.\nBut in 2010 during licence fee negotiations, it was decided that BBC Monitoring would be funded by licence fee-payers. Currently it employs 320 staff in all corners of the globe, but the one constant that has remained for nearly 75 years is its base in Reading.\nFor more than half of the 20th Century, staff at the idyllic country house eavesdropped on the world, but shortly that will be no more.\nMr Smith said: \"It's a tremendous shame that we're getting rid of it.\"", "answer": "For nearly 75 years BBC staff at a sprawling stately home on the outskirts of Reading have been listening in to some of the world's most seismic events, from Nazi Germany's occupation of Europe to the death of Stalin and the Cuban Missile Crisis."}

To avoid a protracted legal battle, BT has now fallen into line.\nThe jury is still out. BT will still control Openreach's budget, even though the newly separated company will have its own boss and decide how to spend its cash.\nReally fast broadband requires running fibre optic cable into every home, which is very expensive. As a result, most UK broadband connections still rely on the elderly copper wires used for telephone calls.\nAndrew Ferguson, of the news website ThinkBroadband, said it is unclear whether separating BT and Openreach will deliver this faster option.\nMost observers agree that the split alone will not solve the UK's broadband problems.\nSlow and non-existent broadband is still an issue in some rural areas and Openreach has been criticised for its failure to address the issue. However, very few other operators appear willing to fix the problem, which is expensive and technically challenging.\nYou have a broadband fault but it is taking weeks to fix.

{"id": 38684434, "question": "The 33-year-old Chile international arrived with a reputation for fancy footwork but is now, to some, thought of as being a shot-stopper who does not stop shots - something Everton took full advantage of when they scored with every effort they had on target in Sunday's 4-0 win.\nCity's defence admittedly did not do much to help him at Goodison Park, but Bravo has now conceded a total of 23 goals from the 57 shots on target he has faced in the Premier League this season.\n\"It looks like people are playing City and thinking if they hit the target, they will score,\" MOTD2 pundit Phil Neville said in his analysis after watching Bravo's latest less than convincing performance.\n\"It is not even as if they are all going into the corners of the net - he is being beaten in the central areas of his goal too.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nDo the stats back up that belief Bravo should have done better? According to Tom Worville, a data scientist at football analysts Opta, the answer is a resounding yes.\nUsing an historical database built using information such as the build-up, distance, angle and placement of more than 250,000 shots, Opta can evaluate 'Expected Goals' - the quality of any chance a player has, and how likely it is to be saved.\nOr, in Bravo's case, whether it should have been...\nBased on the historic quality of those 57 shots on target against City, only 16 should have beaten Bravo, not 23.\nThe £15.4m summer signing from Barcelona has conceded 6.7 goals more than he should have done, putting him in the bottom five of the 23 Premier League keepers to have faced more than 100 shots in 2016-17.\nIt gets worse for Bravo when Opta focus on his current eight-game run that has seen him concede 14 goals from 22 shots on target.\n\"Of those 22 shots, we get an 'Expected Goals' figure of 7.33 - so he has conceded nearly double than expected in that time,\" added Worville. \"It's a huge deficit, and the figures are pretty damning.\n\"I'm hesitant to jump to the conclusion that Bravo is a poor goalkeeper - we know that he isn't - but he's having a terrible time at the moment.\"\nMost keepers are having a better time right now, including all of Bravo's counterparts at other top-six clubs.\nIt is a 12-goal swing from Bravo's figures to those of Burnley's Tom Heaton, the Premier League's top performer by Opta's calculations.\nHeaton has saved almost five 'expected' goals this season - enough to give him the edge over the likes of Tottenham's Hugo Lloris and Arsenal's Petr Cech, who average around three apiece.\nDavid de Gea has 'saved' one goal for Manchester United while Liverpool's Simon Mignolet has conceded one more than expected. All of them are doing much better than Bravo, though.\nFew City fans thought that allowing Joe Hart to leave for a season in Serie A was a good idea back in August. It is possible only Pep Guardiola thinks that is the case now.\nOver in Italy, Hart has had a positive effect to the Torino backline, despite conceding the same amount of goals and playing the same number of minutes as Bravo at City.\nBravo has delivered in one area for City, however, and it is the main reason they signed him in the first place.\nHis passing accuracy in his 18 Premier League games so far is 71.5%, ranked second only to Lloris. That might provide some solace to Guardiola, although even he would probably prefer it if his keeper started making some saves.\n\"Considering Joe Hart has conceded about one goal fewer than expected, it's easy to jump to the conclusion that with him between the sticks, City may have conceded fewer this season,\" Worville explained.\n\"Hart's playing behind a different defence though, which definitely has an impact on the quality of shots that he's facing.\n\"Additionally there's a lot more to goalkeeping than making stops, with the distribution side of things being one of the main reasons Bravo was bought back in the summer.\n\"Having Hart in the team may have lead to fewer goals conceded, but at the same time it may have impacted the style of play Pep wanted to implement.\"", "answer": "For many, Claudio Bravo's first five months in English football were neatly summed up by the caller to the BBC's 606 phone-in last weekend who dubbed the Manchester City goalkeeper a 'false no. 1'."}

England won only two matches, neither against Test nations.\nIndeed, Ireland could have reasonably expected to go through with six points, only for their elimination to come as a result of several factors.\nHeavy losses to South Africa and India damaged their net run rate, West Indies earned three big wins to boost theirs, while Pakistan recovered from two opening defeats to claim four successive victories.\nThis latest win continues the improvement of Misbah-ul-Haq's men, echoing the Pakistan side that began poorly when the tournament was last held in Australia and New Zealand in 1992, only to go and lift the trophy.\nFor Ireland, their creditable showing will be used as evidence by those who say the next World Cup should not be cut from its current 14-team format to only 10 sides.\nThe Irish still have the chance to qualify for that tournament as well as the opportunity to earn Test status through the 2017 Intercontinental Cup.\nVictory over Pakistan at the Adelaide Oval would have seen them progress past the first round of the World Cup for the second time, but they were unable to take enough runs from a disciplined attack, then lacked the penetration and accuracy to make the chase uncomfortable.\nPlenty of the Ireland top order got starts, but there was not enough support for Porterfield, who pulled, clipped and drove his way to the highest score made by an associate captain in a World Cup match.\nHowever, the collective accuracy of the Pakistan pace attack was impressive and, when left-hander Porterfield miscued Sohail Khan to mid-on, the lower order was exposed.\nDespite the sluggish nature of the wicket, the Irish regularly found trouble playing the short ball, with the last six wickets falling for 55 runs.\nIreland's collection of medium-pacers and spinners may have been able to use the conditions to their advantage, but regular width aided the Pakistan cause.\nSarfraz, dropped by wicketkeeper Gary Wilson standing up to Kevin O'Brien on 37, shared an opening stand of 120 with Ahmed Shahzad, whose cut shots benefitted from Irish inaccuracy.\nWhen he skied Stuart Thompson to mid-on and Haris Sohail was run-out in a mix-up with Sarfraz, Irish hopes were revived.\nBut Misbah arrived to steady in a stand of 82, taking two sixes over the leg side before treading on his stumps off Alex Cusack with 30 still required.\nThat left the patient Sarfraz to complete his maiden one-day international hundred, with Umar Akmal belting Paul Stirling down the ground to bring Ireland's spirited campaign to a close.\nListen to highlights from Test Match Special's and 5 live Sport's 2015 World Cup coverage.", "answer": "Ireland were knocked out of the World Cup by Pakistan, who qualified for the quarter-finals with a seven-wicket win."}

Southampton were dangerous on the break in the first half and then, when they needed to be, were superbly organised, disciplined and determined defensively before breaking for Republic of Ireland international Long to strike the killer blow.\nSouthampton have once more demonstrated their ability, as a club, to take the blows of key departures and still achieve.\nThey lost manager Ronald Koeman to Everton in the summer - as well as important components such as Victor Wanyama and Sadio Mane to Spurs and Liverpool respectively - and have carried on undisturbed with a Wembley appearance as their reward.\nLiverpool's laboured performance was in stark contrast to the all-action attacking displays that briefly took them to the top of the Premier League earlier this season.\nJurgen Klopp's side looked jaded and have lost their way, with only one win in seven games this year, a third-round FA Cup replay victory at League Two Plymouth Argyle.\nLiverpool look shorn of threat without £34m summer signing Mane, away at the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal, and lacking an alternative plan when teams as disciplined as Swansea and Southampton have been in inflicting two successive home defeats.\nSturridge felt the frustration of Liverpool's supporters for a poor performance and two missed chances, while substitute Origi looks short of confidence.\nKlopp's decision to play Can and Jordan Henderson together in midfield backfired badly and his decision to leave out Georginio Wijnaldum was questionable.\nSouthampton's players enjoyed every second of their celebrations with their fans in the Anfield Road end as they looked forward to the chance to win their second major trophy, following an FA Cup triumph over Manchester United at Wembley in 1976.\nSaints had several anxious moments in the second half, especially when goalkeeper Forster dropped Can's shot behind him then recovered miraculously to claw it off the line as Sturridge closed in.\nThey also survived two penalty appeals - for handball against Long and that fall from Origi - but this was a glory night for Southampton and one they fully deserved.\nBBC Radio 5 live pundit Mark Lawrenson: \"Absolutely, totally and utterly deserved. They always, always carried that goal threat. They played with so much pace, so much directness. Over the two legs they have totally outplayed Liverpool.

{"id": 37545037, "question": "The sacking of Francesco Guidolin on his 61st birthday and the appointment of Bob Bradley show that may not totally be the case.\nBradley's long and mostly successful career in management has mirrored the game's development in the United States, over nigh on four decades.\nIndeed the 58-year-old's only forays outside the States have been his most recent and have proved mainly successful.\nHis two years in charge of the Egypt national side were played out against a background of violent civil unrest in the North African country.\nBradley's arrival to live in Cairo in October 2011, with his wife Lindsay, coincided with the Egyptian Revolution and the American was praised for choosing to remain in the country when a match erupted into violence leading to the Port Said Stadium riot which killed 70 people in February 2012.\nDespite the Egyptian Premier League being suspended as a result, Bradley took the national side to within one match of qualifying for the 2014 World Cup. The Pharaohs eventually lost to Ghana in a play-off.\nAfter departing Egypt, Bradley headed north. In January 2014 he took over at Norwegian outfit Stabaek, becoming the first American to manage a club in a European top division and then was the first to guide a club to the Europa League.\nThen it was to the club from whom he joins Swansea, France's oldest, Le Havre, where it seemed, again, history beckoned. Last season, under Bradley, they went as close to promotion to Ligue 1 as is possible.\nThey missed out by just one goal scored despite beating Bourg-en-Bresse 5-0 in their final game of the campaign and hitting the woodwork four times.\nAs he arrives in Swansea, supporters will be hoping their new manager's luck has at least improved since then.\nBut despite his recent foreign excursions, Bradley's career has mainly been stepped in Americana.\nHe attended Princeton University and was top scorer for the Princeton Tigers whilst completing his degree in history. But despite his exploits on the pitch it was in coaching and management young Bradley's future lay.\nHe took his first head coaching job aged just 22, at Ohio University whilst studying for an MA in Sports Administration at the same time.\nBradley then rose through the US college system, eventually taking the head coach job at his alma mater, Princeton, leading the Tigers to two Ivy League titles.\nAs the MLS expanded, so Bradley's coaching career took off.\nStarting as assistant at DC United, he eventually became manager at Chicago Fire, the MetroStars, who have since transformed into the New York Red Bulls, and Chivas USA, who are now defunct.\nThere were plenty of accolades for Bradley along the way, including twice being named MLS Coach of the Year.\nBut it is an incident during his time in charge of the MetroStars that illustrates Bradley's quick-thinking.\nIn a game against DC United, Bradley exploited a rule that allowed for a fourth substitution in a match as long as it was a goalkeeper.\nHe switched shot-stopper Tim Howard to an outfield position, brought on midfielder Eddie Gaven between the posts and then swapped the two 10 seconds after the restart. Gaven went on to score the winning goal.\nBradley took over as USA boss in 2006 and led them to a Gold Cup win the following year and a runners-up spot in the Confederations Cup in 2009.\nBut it was in South Africa at the Fifa World Cup in 2010 that Bradley made his name outside of his homeland, guiding them to the knockout stages where they eventually lost out to Ghana.\nHowever, after a series of poor results, he was sacked as national coach in July 2011.\nSo it has been a long, glamorous and at times troubled road to Swansea for Bradley.\nBut one thing about him Swansea supporters might notice is a distinct lack of modesty.\nBack in April, Bradley said he felt he was as good a manager as Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola.\n\"When I have a chance to observe different managers, the ones that do good work,\" Bradley said.\n\"I mention Pochettino, Klopp, Tuchel. We haven't even spoken about the Guardiolas and Ancelottis.\n\"But I'll tell you what, maybe I'm stupid, but I think I'm a manger in and around that level.\"\nBradley is about to get his chance to prove that in the Premier League and Swans supporters will be hoping that all-American confidence is not misplaced.\nSubscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox.", "answer": "When Americans Jason Levien and Steve Kaplan became majority shareholders at Swansea City they vowed to do things the \"Swansea way\"."}

On loan.\nWelcome to Transfer Deadline Day, which I've deliberately written in capitals because there are those who think we should make it a public holiday.\nChaotic and stressful and full of panic buying, Transfer Deadline Day and the window that precedes it make up football's equivalent of the Yuletide season, with Sky Sports' Jim White playing its equivalent of Santa. \"Sorry, no joy with Fabregas, I brought you Fellaini instead.\"\nA magnificent irony of transfer windows is that they were introduced in 2002-03 in part to stabilise the game.\nIt's about ducking and diving, maybe finding a player whose mother-in-law lives in Taunton, 10 miles down the road from Yeovil. Which isn't on most sat-navs\nTransfer windows were part of a compromise deal between football authorities and the European Commission, with the sport insisting on contractual stability for players, and clubs investing in those players, in exchange for freedom of movement at prescribed times of the year.\nYet there is nothing stable about transfer windows and the media coverage that attends them. Indeed, Transfer Deadline Days in Britain, which generate mind-boggling numbers for a wide range of media outlets, have come to resemble the NFL draft in the United States.\nBut here is another irony. The NFL draft is by some measures the second biggest sports story in the United States in any given year because it is the principal means of player acquisition and a genuine game-changer. With the weakest team getting first pick, it democratises the league, theoretically giving every team an equal chance on any given Sunday.\nIn contrast, Transfer Deadline Days involve an awful lot of acquisitions across an unlevel playing field that often change nothing, but still generate enough hot air to make it seem as if they might.\n\"It's a period of time that is false and everything during that period of time is forced,\" says Gary Johnson, manager of Championship side Yeovil.\n\"Everybody has a little panic for the simple reason that the supporters demand a big name, or at least hope for one, and some of this is driven by the media. But for smaller clubs it's very difficult to get someone in that people can gasp at.\"\nIt is difficult to find a manager who is a fan of transfer windows, whether they manage in the Premier League or the lower reaches of the Football League.\nIan Holloway, who managed Blackpool and, briefly, Crystal Palace in the Premier League, reckons transfer windows are \"utter madness\" and lead to \"the headlong hurtling into deals to rescue dreams\".\n\"They encourage knee-jerk reactions, inflated transfer fees and wages and minimal planning and background checks,\" adds Holloway, who parted company with Palace in October and is now at Millwall.\nJohnson, whose side sit second from bottom in the Championship table, spends his Januarys being assailed by hordes of agents hawking players he had never heard of. Like a tourist in an exotic flea market, he usually ends up with something he doesn't really know what to do with.\n\"You don't want to miss anyone,\" said Johnson. \"So you look them up on the computer, find out what they can and can't do. But players with good character are unbelievably difficult to get.\"\nOther managers of smaller clubs lucky enough to have coveted players on their books see transfer windows as tantamount to restraint of trade.\nThe Premier League's counter argument is that either you have contractual stability for players and the squad stability that brings, or you have players being sacked at the drop of a hat or leaving at the drop of a wallet, to borrow a phrase from former Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein.\nHowever, Holloway believes the old system, whereby clubs were allowed to buy and sell players up until and including the third week in March, was a more stable one, in that it allowed clubs to formulate long-term strategies away from the media and fan frenzy that constitutes a transfer window.\nCritics of the January window point to Harry Redknapp's maniacal spending spree last year, when the then recently appointed QPR boss paid more than £20m for Loic Remy and Chris Samba, as evidence that long-term strategies become secondary to short-term fantasies during football's silly season. QPR were relegated a few months later.\nMeanwhile, League Managers' Association chief executive Richard Bevan argues that so many managers are being sacked during the January transfer window and the weeks leading up to it because twitchy owners are unwilling to hand their money over to someone who is perceived to be failing.\nIn addition, Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger says the system causes unrest in the dressing room, in that an out-of-favour player might spend from November to the end of January agitating for a move, or going through the motions for fear of suffering an injury and scuppering a possible move, or worrying that they are about to be supplanted by a new signing and losing motivation as a result.\nWenger, however, has no compunction about causing unrest in rival teams' dressing rooms, having upset Newcastle boss Alan Pardew with a late bid for midfielder Yohan Cabaye last August.\nThe Premier League argues that a smart manager is one who is best able to deal with all these dressing room kerfuffles and play with the cards they were dealt at the start of the season.\nWenger's main complaint has always been with the January window in particular, which he believes distorts the competitive balance midway through a season. Why, asks Wenger, should a club be able to buy their way out of trouble at the expense of a poorer club which had their house in order before the season started?\nWenger's argument is moot for two reasons. First, the old system meant rich clubs were able to run riot with their cheque books for most of the season, not just in January. Second, the January window is effectively a sop to the European Commission and its directives on freedom of movement.\nAs it is, players' union Fifpro claims the current regulations impede players' freedom of movement and is preparing to challenge the system in the European courts.\nAnd while some fans will be of the opinion that well-remunerated players don't deserve the same rights as the rest of us and should take their 50 grand a week and stop complaining, other fans will find it bizarre that footballers, many of them on modest salaries, have fewer rights than other workers.\nWenger does have a point in his criticism of the timing of the summer transfer window. As it stands, the window closes two weeks after the start of the season, meaning a player might play two or three games for one club before being poached by another.\n\"The first game of the season would be a good time to close it,\" says Redknapp. \"Then we could all concentrate on the football.\"\nThe present system was introduced ahead of the 2002-03 season, as part of a compromise with the European Commission.\nThere are two transfer windows each season.\nThe first one for English football commences on 1 July and usually ends at 23:00 BST on 31 August.\nThe second transfer window begins at midnight on 31 December and ends at 23:00 GMT on 31 January, or the first working day after that date.\nBefore the introduction of the transfer window, players could be traded throughout the season up until 31 March.\nEach national football federation has its own registration period, so international transfers can take place if the window in the country of the buying club is still open.\nFree agents can be signed at any time during the season as long as they had been released by their previous club before the end of the transfer window.\nSource: Premier League\nThe difficulty of co-ordinating the transfer window in England with other European leagues is the principal reason why the summer window has not been moved forward.\nBut another reason is that the media and football fans, unlike Redknapp, do not want to concentrate solely on the football. They want to concentrate on Redknapp chatting with reporters about the transfer window through the window of his Range Rover.\nWhen transfer windows were introduced, they were seen as potentially damaging for the red tops, for which transfer tittle-tattle was a staple. But the British media have adapted, turning transfer windows into feeding frenzies for football fans of a dramatic persuasion. Which is most of them.\nLast January, disaffected (you read that word a lot in the football pages in January) West Bromwich Albion striker Peter Odemwingie was spotted outside Loftus Road on Transfer Deadline Day, caught in the act of trying to force through a move to QPR off his own bat.\nThe Odemwingie Fiasco, as it came to be known, had some of the ingredients of a caper movie: brinksmanship, silliness, adventure and audacity, as well as the comedy of embarrassment. And the British media milked it for all it was worth.\nAnd it is in January, when few Premier League powerhouses do big business because of players' involvement in European competition and many trades in the Football League consist of low-key loans, that the British media really excels, making fans believe there is a mega signing lurking around every corner.\n\"All we're trying to do is nick players here and there,\" says Gary Johnson, exposing the unglamorous truth for the majority of Football League clubs.\n\"It's about ducking and diving, maybe finding a player whose mother-in-law lives in Taunton, 10 miles down the road from Yeovil. Which isn't on most sat-navs.\"\nWho knows which players will find their way to Yeovil this Transfer Deadline Day.

The lowest level was at The Hillingdon Hospitals in London at 68%.\nBut Dr Howse warned some hospitals were currently recording - in figures not yet published - rates in the 50s and 60s.\nThese rates matter, he said, because \"people are being seriously put at risk\" at rates of below 80%.\nNeil Carvey, of Leatherhead in Surrey, was advised to go to accident and emergency by a GP after he awoke shivering and in pain following an operation on his spine last December.\nHis partner Ivanel Petrenkov told how they ended up waiting 16 hours at Epsom Hospital on Christmas Day despite there \"being barely anybody there\".\nIt has since emerged Mr Carvey suffered a spinal infection as a result of complications.

{"id": 14084455, "question": "Thomas Condliff, who weighs 22 stone (140kg) and has type 2 diabetes, is challenging a decision to refuse him a gastric bypass operation.\nNHS North Staffordshire says he does not meet its criteria for weight loss surgery.\nDecisions about exceptional funding are based on medical factors alone.\nMr Condliff, 62, was initially refused funding for a gastric bypass operation because his weight/height ratio (Body Mass Index) fell below the threshold set by his local primary care trust.\nAt 22 stone his Body Mass Index (BMI) is about 43, but in North Staffordshire only patients with a BMI over 50 are routinely treated with weight loss surgery.  A decision to refuse him funding as an exceptional case was upheld in an earlier court hearing.\nNow Mr Condliff is taking his legal battle to the Court of Appeal in a case that has implications for many other areas.\nNHS North Staffordshire makes its decisions for exceptional funding on the medical condition of the patient, and rules out considering their personal circumstances.\nAs a result of his diabetes Tom Condliff has lost the sight in one eye, and he also has kidney problems. He can no longer stand or walk for more than a short time and relies on his wife, Lana, to help him wash and dress.\nHe says that during his legal battle his quality of life has worsened, and even an extremely calorie-restricted diet has failed to help him lose weight.\n\"I've been given about a year to live by one of the specialists. I feel more and more poorly each day, my diabetes is way out of control.\"\nHaving failed to overturn the initial decision to refuse a gastric bypass, he is now resting his hopes on asking the courts to compel the NHS to take into account the impact on his life and that of his family.\n\"My wife barely goes out, because she doesn't want to leave me. It's awful just being locked indoors. It doesn't matter where you live, how nice it is, it's still a cage. \"\nIn the two-day hearing, the Court of Appeal will hear evidence from both sides on whether Article 8 of the Human Rights Act should be applied to how the NHS makes decisions on funding. It sets out the broad right to a family life.\nIn common with many other primary care trusts, North Staffordshire has a policy of only considering medical evidence when it makes decisions about exceptional funding. The trust says it is part of a commitment to deal with all patients in a fair and even handed manner.\nIn order to be granted exceptional funding a patient has to show he would have a greater than average medical benefit from any treatment.\nIf Mr Condliff was successful, the PCT would have to look again at his case, but could still reach the same decision. It might also open the door to further legal challenges.\nAlthough this will not be considered by the court the case also highlights the variation in funding for weight loss surgery.\nThe guidelines for the NHS in England and Wales suggest patients should be considered if they have a BMI of over 40, or lower if they have other serious medical conditions.\nThe Royal College of Surgeons has argued that many patients who meet those criteria and could benefit from an operation are turned down at local level for NHS treatment.\nJudgement in Mr Condliff's case is set to be reserved until a later date.", "answer": "The Court of Appeal will consider if a patient's personal circumstances should influence the NHS when it decides whether to fund treatment."}

{"id": 39410915, "question": "And the classic BBC comedy series Fawlty Towers is being deployed by some teachers in an attempt to give Japanese students an example of spoken English - rather than focusing on written language and grammar.\nJapan's government and businesses want to use the Olympics to boost tourism and global trade and to present a positive image of Japan to the world.\nSo the government needs to ensure a supply of English speakers to be Olympic volunteers and work in the accommodation, tourism, and retail industries.\nThere is also a demand for professionals, such as doctors and nurses, to speak to visitors or competitors in English.\nJapan's government has been working to bridge this English language gap.\nThe subject is now taught in school from when students are eight or nine years old and remains compulsory for the next seven years.\nUniversity students and school teachers have been sent on trips abroad to learn English, and many universities are giving language lessons to prospective Olympic volunteers.\nThere are even proposals to create an \"English village\" in Tokyo, populated entirely by English-speakers, where learners could immerse themselves in the language.\nBut early indications are that progress has been slow, and the country still comes surprisingly far down global rankings of English proficiency.\nMore stories from the BBC's Global education series looking at education from an international perspective, and how to get in touch.\nYou can join the debate at the BBC's Family & Education News Facebook page.\nJapan is 40th out of 48 countries on the Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC), and last year it fell from \"moderate proficiency\" to \"low proficiency\" on EF's English Proficiency Index.\nSo why is learning English so difficult for the Japanese?\nMegumi Tada, an education expert at Hirosaki University, said the main reason is \"the lack of teachers who can effectively use the language\".\nWhen the Kyoto Board of Education asked middle school English teachers to take the TOEIC, fewer than one in four teachers reached the threshold for language skills good enough for most social demands and limited work requirements.\nMs Tada said that although the government has now introduced English in primary schools, most of the teachers in these schools are not qualified to teach the language.\nShe said a better way to improve English teaching would be to increase the number of trained teachers in primary and secondary schools, and to train them for longer.\nThere are also questions about the way English is taught in schools. The focus tends to be on grammar, vocabulary and writing, which are repeatedly tested in high-pressure exams.\nAs a result, English is rarely spoken in Japanese classrooms.\nJunnosuke Nakamura, who leads the education company EF in Japan, has said that \"too often in our schools, a Japanese national is teaching English in Japanese, and English must be taught in English\".\nHe said the government's reforms \"have not actually changed anything at a fundamental level\".\nHelen Bentley, who worked on Tokyo's Olympic bid for communications firm Finsbury, said: \"There are relatively few opportunities to use spoken English in Japan.\n\"As a result, many Japanese are much stronger at reading and writing than they are at speaking.\"\nThere are teachers trying a more imaginative approach to getting students to speak English - such as setting them comedies to watch for homework.\nTeachers in Fukuoka Prefecture have been using Fawlty Towers and Red Dwarf to get students used to hearing spoken English.\nIt raises the prospect of a generation of Japanese students sounding like Basil, Sybil or even Manuel.\nThere is also a barrier from a culture of perfectionism in Japanese education, with a belief that there is a \"right\" way to do something.\nStudents do not want to make mistakes and they will not attempt something until they are sure they can get it right.\nThis might be a good thing for literacy and numeracy - Japan comes consistently near the top of global rankings such as PISA.\nBut it does not work so well for languages, for which speaking and making mistakes are crucial to learning.\nFumiko Inoue, who lectures in Japanese language and cross-cultural management at Rotterdam Business School, pointed to the experience of one of her Dutch students who taught English in a school in Tokyo.\nAt first, the new teacher was surprised that students were reluctant to speak English in class, but after a lot of encouragement she got them to chat to each other in the language.\nThat is, until she was observed by a senior teacher who criticised her students for making too many grammatical mistakes.\n\"If you don't say anything, you don't make any mistakes either, of course,\" said Prof Inoue.\nThis teaching style can have lifelong effects on how Japanese people approach the English language.\n\"We Japanese have a strong psychological barrier to speaking English,\" said Kumiko Iwasaki, a professor of psychology and education at the Open University of Japan.\n\"We have an obsession that we have to speak English perfectly.\"", "answer": "Japan is struggling to make sure it has enough proficient English speakers when it hosts the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2020."}

{"id": 33270070, "question": "Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras came to power on a wave of public anger over austerity measures, and he is urging the Greek people to vote against austerity once more in a snap referendum on the country's debt crisis to be held on Sunday.\nMeanwhile tens of thousands of people took part in anti-austerity demonstrations across the UK in June despite the government's insistence that austerity measures are vital to cutting the deficit.\nMany countries decided to cut spending and put up taxes to deal with the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis. Were they right? Has austerity worked? Four experts offer their assessment.\nFormer BBC economics editor Stephanie Flanders is now chief market strategist for JP Morgan Asset Management.\n\"In 2009 we suddenly found ourselves in a much steeper recession than people thought, and the impact was suddenly very clear on the public finances. It pushed up budget deficits all over the world - particularly in the UK - by tens of billions.\n\"No one was making any money or paying any tax, meanwhile the unemployment numbers were going up quite quickly and that was pushing up costs. There was a moment leading up to the G20 summit in London in 2009 where leaders said 'we've got to have a global co-ordinated stimulus'.\n\"They were all on one side saying, 'we've got to not worry too much about borrowing going up, because governments are the only ones who can afford to do this at a time when households and companies are also cutting back'.\n\"[As a result] you saw the start of a recovery in most countries, and at the same time these horrendous borrowing numbers were coming in which we hadn't ever seen in peace time. And there were mutterings: 'Hang on, we're going to face an awful lot of pain to get that down, shouldn't we start doing that now?'.\n\"So they faced that dilemma: 'we've saved the economy, how quickly do we start to raise taxes again and cut spending to get our public finances in order and how quickly can we afford to do that without hurting this still fragile recovery?'\n\"If you think the economy is going to carry on growing, then you want to take a bit of that growth and start to put it back into the government coffers.\n\"You want to have taxes going up, certainly some plans to rein in spending, but of course the contrary argument is you can't assume that growth, because some of it is coming from what you're doing to prop up the economy.\n\"Unless you know that there's going to be other demand out there to make up the gap, you might face the economy slipping back into recession and then the borrowing is going be even worse.\n\"If the international lenders start to worry about whether you're going to pay it back, they start to charge you more interest, and if they charge you more interest, then your interest rates of course go up, and that pushes up your borrowing as well - you might be damned if you do, and damned if you don't.\nPhilip Coggan writes for The Economist.\n\"Most people think of being austere as living a very quiet life, not spending too much, especially not spending more than you earn. But that's not what economists mean by austerity. Economists mean the change in your financial position.\n\"Britain went from spending 11% of GDP more than it earned in one year to 9% of GDP more than it earned. That is still doling out money to the rest of the economy, but technically the change of position means that they're cutting spending, or raising taxes, and that makes the policy austere.\n\"There was one big tax rise - VAT - at the start of the parliament, and then there were big cuts to capital spending on new schools, new hospitals, new roads.\n\"[Austerity] was very strong for the first two years, so up to the middle of 2012. From that point on, the amount of austerity - the amount of cutting - slowed quite significantly. Some people argue that the government changed tack, and to the extent that the UK economy recovered, then that was all down to this change of tack.\n\"I don't think we can absolutely sure [whether austerity worked]. To have a proper scientific experiment, you need a control, in which case you need to rerun the economy without what the government did and see what happened. Alas we can never do that.\n\"The experience in Europe suggests that too much austerity can be counterproductive, and we've seen that in Greece, where the overall economy has shrunk by 25% over the last four or five years, because foreign creditors have made Greece cut back. That does seem to have overdone it.\n\"Some people say, if you have a central bank that's willing to do [quantitative easing: effectively printing money], you don't have to worry about the budget deficit. You can print as much money as you like, you can raise as much debt as you like, and indeed you should do so while rates are so low and spend it on infrastructure projects.\n\"Would the Bank of England have been willing to do that if the government had said it wasn't bothered about the level of the public sector deficit? Remember it's an independent bank. If you go back to 2010 and see what the [then] Bank of England governor Mervyn King was saying, he didn't give that impression.\n\"So I think it's a bit optimistic to say that the government in 2010 could have done absolutely nothing and got away with it.\"\nJustin Wolfers is professor of economics at the University of Michigan, where the US federal government followed a policy of economic stimulus for a little longer than the UK.\n\"The relevant question for the US is whether stimulus worked.\n\"Lehman Brothers collapsed, unemployment was soaring, and the Obama administration passed the Stimulus Bill. That was a big part of what supported the economy through 2008, particularly 2009 and 2010.\n\"At that point quite a lot of the other economies in the world began to pull back on the extent of the stimulus that they were putting into the economy.\n\"Essentially the US just let its Stimulus Bill lapse. So what had been supporting the economy through 2009 and through 2010 went away. But there was no concerted effort to immediately or swiftly reduce the public debt. The view was that we should let the economy try and recover.\n\"The big Stimulus Bill for 2008, 2009, 2010 had specific formulae which ended up giving different amounts of stimulus to different states. You can look at those states which happened to get a bigger chunk of stimulus. Did their economy subsequently outperform other states over the next few years? The answer is yes.\"\n\"The really big costs are about repaying the debt. We do have a higher debt than we used to have, that gives us higher interest payments each year, and that's a real burden, and it's a burden that will slow growth in the future.\n\"Borrowing from the future just brings spending from the future to the present, and so there is a real cost, and it's one to be taken quite seriously.\"\nProfessor Sir Charles Bean was deputy governor at the Bank of England during the financial crisis.\n\"It's easy to forget the external dimensions. Obviously for the UK, what's been happening on our doorstep in the eurozone has been an important factor on the development of growth here.\n\"Arguments over 'well, if the government had adopted less aggressive fiscal consolidation we would have grown faster' - and the fact that we saw very little growth during 2011, 2012, reflected that fiscal choice - ignore the fact that across the Channel we were seeing this downturn in our primary export market.\n\"The question of austerity is often used as a bit of a code word for other, deeper differences of view about the role of the state.\n\"Often when people talk about austerity, they're not really talking about just getting the budget deficit down, they're actually talking about the size of the state. People who object to it are basically saying they want a bigger public sector.\n\"That is a big fundamental question. You can have a big public sector, providing it's paid for with higher taxes.

But each has found this winter to be particularly difficult.\nSpending: £2,057 per person\nKey fact: Just one hospital trust hit the four-hour A&E target in the first week of January.\nThe system: The NHS is split between providers of services, known as NHS trusts, and commissioners, working for clinical commissioning groups. Social care, covering care homes and help in the home, is organised by councils and is means-tested.\nThe story so far: The first week of January was the most difficult since the four-hour target was introduced in 2004.\nThe proportion of patients being treated or discharged in time fell below 78%, with nearly half of hospitals declaring major alerts because of a shortage of beds.\nAn estimated one in five patients ended up facing long delays for a bed after an emergency admission - double the normal rate - while ambulance crews reported problems handing over patients to A&E staff.\nIt comes after a gradual increase in pressures in recent years. The winters have been getting progressively worst, while the 62-day target for cancer treatment to begin following an urgent GP referral has been missed for 11 months in a row.\nThe number of people on hospital waiting lists for a routine operation has also been rising.\nNHS bosses set out a five-year vision for the NHS, which involved a greater emphasis on keeping people well in the community. But savings also have to be made - there is a £22bn target for 2020.\nThis has led to the development of 44 local plans to overhaul services - some of which involve closing hospitals and cutting staff.\nSpending: £2,125 per person\nKey fact: 63% of A&E patients were seen in four hours over the Christmas period.\nThe system: There are five integrated health and care boards that run hospitals, community services and social care. The over-75s get free care in their own home if they have high needs.\nThe story so far: Northern Ireland has some of the worst performance figures in the UK.\nDuring the Christmas period, the number of patients seen in four hours in A&E departments dropped to 63%.\nExactly the same proportion started their cancer treatment within 62 days, according to the latest statistics, while the numbers waiting longer than they should for a routine operation have almost doubled in the past four years.\nIn response to the growing pressures, ministers have already set out a new vision for the health service, which they acknowledged was at \"breaking point\".\nA 10-year plan was published in the autumn, which called for greater investment in general practice as a way of coping with the rising demands on hospitals.\nThe plan was widely criticised for its lack of detail and costings.\nIt did not mention hospital closures, but there is a general consensus that Northern Ireland has too many small units and care would be better concentrated in fewer bigger centres.\nPolitical instability in Northern Ireland, which is facing its second assembly election in less than a year, also means the budget for the next financial year has yet to be agreed.\nSpending: £2,160 per person\nKey fact: Scotland was the last nation to hits its A&E target - in July.\nThe system: The NHS is run by 14 health boards that organise hospital and community services. Social care is organised by councils with personal care - that is help with  washing and dressing - provided free in people's homes and residential care if an individual has high needs.\nThe story so far: Out of all the four nations, hospitals in Scotland seem to have fared the best.\nWeekly data shows four-hour performance in major units hovering around the 90% mark during January.\nMuch of the credit has been given to the way councils and the health service are working together.\nBudgets have been pooled, encouraging a close working relationship to help get frail patients out of hospital by providing extra rehabilitation services in the community.\nBut most of the progress has been concentrated in and around Glasgow and Edinburgh, where over a quarter of the population lives.\nArguably, this gives Scotland an advantage, as improvements in just two regions can have a significant impact on performance.\nIn terms of cancer treatment, over 87% started treatment within 62 days, according to the latest figures, below the 95% target.\nSpending: £2,084 per person\nKey fact: 81% of patients were seen in four hours in A&E during December.\nThe system: The NHS is run by seven health boards that organise hospital and community services.

The players's recollection is that it was more of a blunt ultimatum - shape up or ship out.\nResults were immediate, with 17 wins from the remaining 25 games, including an unbeaten run of 13 away games, and then promotion via the play-offs.\nIpswich were dispatched in the semi-final, after Neil assured his players their opponents would run out of steam in the second leg at Carrow Road because they played at such a high intensity. Norwich scored twice in the second half and then defeated Middlesbrough in the final after Neil told his players that their opponents had only come back from conceding the opening goal once in four years.

This was more than double the number in the same period in 2013, partly reflecting customers delaying accessing their pots until the reforms had taken place, the committee heard.\nAnnuity sales dropped to 12,000 for the same three months, compared with 90,000 in the same quarter of 2013.\nSome 121,000 customers had opted for cash withdrawal and 71,000 had accessed some form of product to draw income from a pension fund that remained invested.\nMaking these financial decisions left many people at risk of being exploited by con-artists, the committee said.\n\"Financial scammers are notoriously adept at reinventing themselves to take advantage of such opportunities. But this does not mean scams should be accepted as a fact of life,\" the committee said.\nIn response, the government said it was working hard to tackle the issue.\n\"The Government has been absolutely clear that any attempt to exploit people who have worked hard and saved for their retirement is unacceptable, which is why we are working with police, regulators and other bodies to raise awareness and take action to protect consumers,\" said a spokesperson for HM Treasury.\nAnother danger was the lack of suitable advice for many people approaching retirement, especially those of middle-incomes.\nFrank Field, who chairs the committee, said: \"We have seen all too clearly, too many times, what happens when financial information is not properly provided and regulated.

{"id": 40422817, "question": "Ex-Football Association chairman Geoff Thompson made the admission when interviewed during an inquiry into the 2018 and 2022 World Cup hosting bids.\nOn Tuesday, football's world governing body Fifa released the full 2014 report of the investigation.\nThat followed leaked extracts being published by German newspaper Bild.\nThe 422-page report was written by former Fifa independent ethics investigator Michael Garcia.\nHe quit in protest when the organisation only released a 42-page summary of his document.\nThat version cleared Russia and Qatar, winners of the 2018 and 2022 hosting rights respectively, of corruption allegations.\nHowever, it was critical of the actions of some Fifa executive committee members and some of the bidding teams, including England's.\nThe full report goes into more detail about this conduct, and also cites an interview given by the 2018 England World Cup bid chief Thompson around the national team's plans to travel to Thailand to secure a vote for their bid.\nThe offer to stage the friendly was made only eight days before the vote in 2010 to decide the 2018 and 2022 hosts. The offer was withdrawn three weeks later, by which stage it was clear Thailand had not supported the English bid.\nThe FA was open at the time about the friendly being arranged to win support.\nBut Garcia's report reads: \"Top English football officials recognised that arranging friendlies with a team from an executive committee's home country in order to advance the England 2018 bid was improper.\n\"Geoff Thompson candidly told the investigatory chamber he 'didn't think it was appropriate' to organise the proposed England-Thailand match-up or other friendlies targeting teams associated with executive committee members 'because I think it's a form of bribery'.\n\"The game's cancellation only underscores the improper relationship between the 24 November 2010 offer to play the game and the 2 December World Cup vote.\"\nFifa said its president Gianni Infantino had always intended to release the full document, but its former ethics chiefs had refused to publish it.\nThe former chairmen of the ethics committee, Cornel Borbely and Hans-Joachim Eckert, were replaced in May after completing four-year terms.\nSpeaking in October 2014, Eckert said: \"Publishing the report in full would actually put the Fifa ethics committee and Fifa itself in a very difficult situation legally.\"\nThe pair moved to clarify their position later on Tuesday, issuing a statement which said the decision not to publish \"was in line with Fifa rules\" as some cases brought as a result of the report were still ongoing.\nThey added: \"To this day, Mr Infantino has never contacted us and asked for a publication.\"\nFifa said it had intended to discuss the release of the report at a meeting next month, but added: \"As the document has been illegally leaked to a German newspaper, the new chairpersons have requested the immediate publication of the full report in order to avoid the dissemination of any misleading information.\n\"For the sake of transparency, Fifa welcomes the news that this report has now been finally published.\"\nQatar 2022 officials said they welcomed the report's publication, although they questioned \"the timing of the leak\", and said it represented \"a vindication of the integrity of our bid\".\nBBC sports editor Dan Roan\nEver since ex-Fifa investigator Michael Garcia resigned in protest at the way his landmark corruption probe was handled in 2014, his secret report has been one of sport's great mysteries. Did it contain information that might force Fifa into a sensational re-vote for the hosting of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups?\nThe fact Fifa itself has finally published the report (albeit only after it had been forced to by a leak to a German newspaper), suggests it does not. Yes, the bidding process was highly dubious, and yes, Fifa executives were evasive, uncooperative and exploited \"a culture of entitlement\". But that is hardly a surprise.  And with Garcia denied full access to bank accounts, and no subpoena power, explosive allegations were always unlikely.\nThere are new details over the lengths most of the bid teams went to in order to curry favour with Fifa's discredited executives, including the FA. Amid highly embarrassing revelations, we now know Prince William and David Cameron were present when a vote-trading deal was agreed by former FA and England 2018 bid chairman Geoff Thompson, in breach of anti-collision rules.\nBut other details were already known. Garcia reinforces the perception of a culture of greed that it is now widely accepted to have gripped football's governing body.\nBut events have overtaken his report, with most of the former Fifa executive committee members that voted for Russia and Qatar already banned for unethical behaviour, indicted or under scrutiny. Criminal investigations into the bidding process continue.\nWhile it does not appear to be a 'smoking gun', the report will be uncomfortable reading for Qatar. Among other details, Garcia says its 2022 bid used the Doha-based academy Aspire to \"curry favour with executive committee members\", and that this \"served to undermine the integrity of the bidding process\".\nQatar's hosting is already under renewed scrutiny amid a diplomatic crisis with its neighbours over its alleged support of extremism. Meanwhile, as it prepares to stage the final of the Confederations Cup, 2018 host Russia has been forced to fend off new doping allegations.\nBut with Garcia writing back in 2014 that he did \"not intend to pursue formal investigatory proceedings against any individual bid team member\", both hosts crucially appear to be in the clear.\nGarcia was appointed as Fifa's independent ethics investigator in 2012 and asked to look into the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding process following claims of corruption around the bids.\nThey included allegations that disgraced Qatari football official Mohamed bin Hammam made payments totalling $5m (£3m) to football officials in return for their support for the Qatar bid.\nQatar vehemently denied votes were being bought and said Bin Hammam had not been acting in an official capacity.\nGarcia spent two years investigating the claims and looked into all nine hosting bids - including one by the English FA.\nRussia won the right to host the 2018 World Cup, beating England as well as joint bids by the Netherlands/Belgium and Spain/Portugal.\nAt the same time, in December 2010, Qatar won the 2022 bid ahead of Australia, Japan, South Korea and the United States.\nFifa released a 42-page summary of Garcia's final report in 2014. It cleared Qatar of any wrongdoing, ending any possibility of a re-vote for a new 2022 host.\nHowever, the report said there were \"certain indications of potentially problematic conduct of specific individuals\" - though Bin Hammam's payments were judged to be for his personal political interests, not the 2022 bid.\nRussia, meanwhile, was also cleared of any wrongdoing, though the investigation had \"only a limited amount of documents available for review\" because the Russian team's computers had been destroyed.\nThe English FA was accused of acting improperly in trying to win votes and flouting bid rules, while Australia too received criticism.\nWhile Russia and Qatar welcomed the report, the FA baulked at the criticism.\nThe man who led the investigation, Garcia, complained Eckert's precis of his report was \"erroneous\".\nEckert denied that, insisting of his published summary: \"A lot of my report was word for word from the Garcia report.\"\nGarcia subsequently quit and Fifa's critics said it showed the shortened, released report had been a \"whitewash\" and called for the full report to be released.\nAlmost three years later, they have got their wish.", "answer": "A plan for England to play a friendly in Thailand to win backing for their 2018 World Cup bid was \"a form of bribery\", investigators were told."}

In 2015 that figure was 34% Labour and 35% Conservative.\nThat compares with people with no academic qualifications above GCSE, who in 2017 split 33% for Labour and 55% for the Conservatives and in 2015 split 30% for Labour and 38% for the Conservatives.\nRead more from Reality Check\nFollow us on Twitter", "answer": "YouGov has released the first big poll of how different groups voted at the general election - we will update this article as more figures are released."}

{"id": 40993250, "question": "At Turf Moor on Saturday, Burnley and West Brom played out a game in which the ball was in play for only 160 seconds more than it was out.\nThough these are early days, no Premier League match so far this season has seen less action.\nTwo months ago, football's lawmakers revealed they were considering scrapping 45-minute halves, instead introducing two periods of 30 minutes, during which the clock would be stopped every time the ball went out.\nThe proposal, the International Football Association Board said, was one of a number of options to deter football's \"negativities\".\nSo would the rule have benefited supporters at Premier League matches so far this season? In a word, yes.\nOf 19 top-flight games across the opening two weekends of the campaign, the ball has been in play for more than an hour in only two of them.\nAnd no game has featured more than 61 minutes of play.\nFood for thought for fans and lawmakers alike.\nHere's the rest of the key Premier League statistics from the weekend.\nIt was a landmark weekend for Wayne Rooney as he joined Alan Shearer in the 200 Premier League goals club with his strike against Manchester City on Monday.\nHere's how and when he has scored them.\nRooney has some way to go to beat former Newcastle and Blackburn striker Shearer's record of 260 goals, although his goal at Etihad Stadium was his fifth in his past eight Premier League games.\nIf he can keep that up then who knows...\n... try, try again?\nWell doing just that doesn't appear to be yielding results in the Premier League so far this season.\nHarry Kane must have some sort of pox on him that prevents him from scoring in August, and it's hard not to sympathise as everything conspired to deny him a goal against Chelsea on Sunday.\nHe's attempted 14 shots so far this term - no player has managed more - all without reward.\n\"Obviously my decision not to read the British press was one of the best I ever made in my life.\"\nJudging by the above quote, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp was perhaps getting a little tired of the criticism of his side's defending before they beat Crystal Palace 1-0 on Saturday.\nIt was a welcome clean sheet after the Reds conceded three in their Premier League opener against Watford and then let in a late goal in the midweek 2-1 Champions League play-off win at Hoffenheim. But is their defence really a problem?\nOn the face of it, the statistics suggest it is. No team has made more errors that have led to goals than Liverpool since 2012, while the Reds have not managed to concede fewer than 40 goals a season since 2009-10.\nA concern, no doubt, for a side with title ambitions. Only once in the past seven seasons has the Premier League been won by a side that has shipped 40 goals or more - Manchester United in 2012-13 (43).\nHowever, things appear to be going in the right direction under Klopp. Liverpool conceded eight fewer goals last season than they did in the German's first at Anfield, while Saturday's result against Palace was a fifth clean sheet from their past six Premier League games, as many as in the previous 21.\nThe run of four clean sheets in Liverpool's final four games of last season came with Joel Matip and Dejan Lovren in the side. When they are able to start together, Liverpool are generally rock solid at the back - of the 18 league games they started last season, the Reds lost just once and kept eight clean sheets.\nPossession football. Two words that will have Arsenal fans shuddering.\nThe Gunners often come out on top of the possession statistics but their game at Stoke on Saturday perhaps took the biscuit. With 77.3%, Arsene Wenger's side 'enjoyed' their highest possession figure in a single Premier League match since the 2003-04 season - yet lost 1-0.\nIt was a similar story for Tottenham. Against Chelsea in their first Premier League home game at Wembley, they threw everything (possibly including the kitchen sink) at the opposition goal, dominating the possession statistics with 68% of the ball - but ended up on the wrong side of a 2-1 result.\nClearly Chelsea were taking a leaf out of Burnley's books. Last weekend, the Clarets had just 38% possession compared with 62% for the Blues, but came away with the victory.\nJavier Hernandez did what Javier Hernandez does best on Saturday - score from inside the box.\nThe former Manchester United striker returned to English football by joining West Ham in the summer and scored in the Premier League for the first time since April 2014 with a brace against Southampton. Just like his strike against Newcastle 1,232 days ago, both of those goals came from within 18 yards.\nIn fact, not one of Hernandez's 39 goals in the Premier League have been scored from outside the area, making him one of the most lethal close-range finishers to have played in England's top flight.\nHernandez's failure to score from outside of the box is not for the want of trying.\nAgainst Southampton, the Mexico international had three shots on goal. Two from inside the box which ended up in the back of the net, the other from long range which, you've guessed it, went wide.\nThe fox in the box is very much in style. Of the 50 goals scored in the Premier League so far this season, only four have come from outside the area.\nLife just continues to get better and better for Huddersfield fans.\nThe Terriers, back in the big time after a 45-year absence, made it two wins from two in the Premier League by beating Newcastle 1-0 on Sunday.\nIt means they are now only the third team in Premier League history to win their first two games following promotion. Bolton, in 2001-02, went to finish 16th and earn another stint in the top flight - but Hull City last season would go on to be relegated. A sign that the season is a marathon and not a sprint.\nBut perhaps youthful exuberance will see David Wagner's men continue to upset the odds.
