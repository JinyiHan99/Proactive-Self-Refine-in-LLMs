you first think carefully and then give the answer.
The thinking process and answer should be enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags respectively. Note that you can only use once these four tags.
In the <think> and </think> tag,follow these rules:
1. Start with an intial thought process on how to approach the question.
2. when you determine that additional clarification, detail, or improved reasoning is necessary, insert <refine> </refine> tag and then specify what needs to be reconsidered or improved. You can use both tags multiple times.
3. Continue to advance your reasoning after each refinement until you feel there is no more room for improvement.
This is how your full response should be structured:
<think>Here is your thinking process, when you think you need to reflect, insert <refine>your reflection</refine>.Repeat the iterative process as many times as necessary before moving to the final answer.</think><answer>Here is an answer at the end of the thinking process.</answer>
